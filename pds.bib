	abstract = {Subjective predicates have two interpretive and distributional characteristics that have resisted a comprehensive analysis. First, the use of a subjective predicate to describe an object is in general felicitous only when the speaker has a particular kind of familiarity with relevant features of the object; characterizing an object as tasty, for example, implies that the speaker has experience of its taste. Second, subjective predicates differ from objective predicates in their distribution under certain types of propositional attitude verbs. The goal of this paper is to argue that these features can be explained in a uniform way and within a broadly truth-conditional approach to semantic content, given a view of subjective language as an essentially pragmatic, context-sensitive phenomenon. Specifically, we propose that what renders an issue subjective in discourse is speakers’ awareness of counterstance contingency: contingency relative to information states that represent alternative pragmatic stances.},

We focus in particular on inference patterns that are correlated with morphosyntactic distribution, as determined by how well those patterns predict the acceptability judgments in the MegaAcceptability dataset. We find that there are 15 such patterns attested. Similarities among these patterns suggest the possibility of underlying lexical semantic components that give rise to them. We use principal component analysis to discover these components and suggest generalizations that can be derived from them.},

Meanwhile, formal pragmatic theories make explicit predictions about meaning in context, but generally without a well-defined compositional semantics. We propose a combined framework for the semantic and pragmatic interpretation of sentences in the face of probabilistic knowledge. We do so by (1) extending a Montagovian interpretation scheme to generate a distribution over possible meanings, and (2) generating a posterior for this distribution using a variant of the Rational Speech Act (RSA) models, but generalised to arbitrary propositions. These aspects of our framework are tied together by evaluating entailment under probabilistic uncertainty. We apply our model to anaphora resolution and show that it provides expected biases under suitable assumptions about the distributions of lexical and world-knowledge. Further, we observe that the model's output is robust to variations in its parameters within reasonable ranges.},

Traditional dynamic approaches track local context by remaking clause denotations into context update functions. This requires crafting for each semantic operator an update recipe that is not fully determined by its truth conditions, failing to capture how local contexts depend only on truth conditions and order of evaluation. In other theories, computing local contexts involves reasoning about the set of all possible grammatical syntactic completions, which relocates local contexts outside of the semantics. I show how to build local contexts systematically and uniformly as part of the composition of ordinary truth conditions. The result is a minimalist dynamic semantics in which the only thing that is dynamically tracked is the semantic content of what has already been said.},

By adapting compositional techniques for dealing with exceptionally scoping indefinites (Charlow, in On the semantics of exceptional scope, PhD thesis, Rutgers University, 2014; The scope of alternatives: indefiniteness and islands. Linguist and Philos 43(4):427–472, 2020), we develop an intensional grammar in which exceptional de re is achieved via cyclic scope. World-sensitive expressions are converted into scope-takers via a constrained inventory of type-flexible operators. Type flexibility explains the possibility of apparently island-violating de re by predicting the possibility of cyclic scope-taking. We argue that the resulting theory—which we dub the flexible scope theory—is sufficiently expressive to address the under-generation issues of current accounts, while still capturing constraints on de re in an explanatory fashion.},

An analogous problem arises for metalinguistic information in Barker’s model, and I suggest that a similar enrichment is needed here as well. The result is a probabilistic theory of linguistic representation that retains a classical metalanguage but avoids the undesirable divorce between meaning and use inherent in the epistemic theory [34]. I also show that the probabilistic approach provides a plausible account of the sorites paradox and higher-order vagueness and that it fares well empirically and conceptually in comparison to leading competitors.},

With an empirical focus on indefinites in English, I show how this approach improves on standard alternative-semantic architectures that use point-wise composition to subvert islands, as well as on in situ approaches to indefinites more generally. Unlike grammars based on point-wise composition, scope-based alternative management is thoroughly categorematic, doesn’t under-generate readings when multiple sources of alternatives occur on an island, and is compatible with standard treatments of binding. Unlike all in situ (pseudo-scope) treatments of indefinites, relying on a true scope mechanism prevents over-generation when an operator binds into an indefinite. My account relies only on function application, some mechanism for scope-taking, and two freely-applying type-shifters: the first is Karttunen’s (Linguist Philos 1(1):3–44, 1977. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00351935) proto-question operator, aka Partee’s (in: Groenendijk, de Jongh, Stokhof (eds) Studies in discourse representation theory and the theory of generalized quantifiers, Foris, Dordrecht, 1986) IDENT, and the second can be factored out of extant approaches to the semantics of questions in the tradition of Karttunen (1977). These type-shifters form a decomposition of LIFT, the familiar function mapping values into scope-takers. Exceptional scope of alternative-generating expressions arises via (snowballing) scopal pied-piping: indefinites take scope over their island, which then itself takes scope.},

Contemporary research differs with respect to whether these factors are taken to independently modulate interpreters’ inferences, or whether a content’s at-issueness is constrained by interpreters’ prior beliefs about the content. This paper reports the results of an experiment investigating projection inferences, that is, inferences about whether the speaker is committed to content contributed by an expression in an entailment-canceling environment. The relevant expressions under investigation are sentences containing clause-embedding predicates. We replicate the effects of prior beliefs and at-issueness on projection inferences, and do not find support for the assumption that a content’s at-issueness is constrained by interpreters’ prior beliefs about it. This result provides support for theoretical models of utterance interpretation that assume the two factors are independent.},

Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, language, and context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, we describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena, such as hyperbole and vagueness, occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.},

We suggest that these phenomena can be explained by the interaction of a free threshold variable in the meaning of the positive form with a probabilistic model of pragmatic inference. We describe a formal model of utterance interpretation as coordination, which jointly infers the value of the threshold variable and the intended meaning of the sentence. We report simulations exploring the effect of background statistical knowledge on adjective interpretation in this model. Motivated by these simulation results, we suggest that this approach can account for the correlation between scale structure and the relative/absolute distinction while also allowing for exceptions noted in previous work. Finally, we argue for a probabilistic explanation of why the sorites paradox is compelling with relative adjectives even though the second premise is false on a universal interpretation, and show that this account predicts Kennedyâ€™s (2007) observation that the sorites paradox is more compelling with relative than with absolute adjectives.},

This involves estimating the probability of the hypothesis, given the data supplied by the premises of an argument. It uses a syntactic parser to generate typed syntactic structures that serve as input to a model generation system. Sentences are interpreted compositionally to probabilistic programs, and the corresponding truth values are estimated using sampling methods. BIS successfully deals with various probabilistic semantic phenomena, including frequency adverbs, generalised quantifiers, generics, and vague predicates. It performs well on a number of interesting probabilistic reasoning tasks. It also sustains most classically valid inferences (instantiation, de Morgan's laws, etc.). To test BIS we have built an experimental test suite with examples of a range of probabilistic and classical inference patterns.},

We apply our semantics to examples with several predicates and generalised quantifiers, including higher-order quantifiers. It captures the vagueness of predication (both gradable and non-gradable), without positing a precise boundary for classifier application. We present a basic account of semantic learning based on our semantic system. We compare our proposal to other current theories of probabilistic semantics, and we show that it offers several important advantages over these accounts.},

Finally we discuss some of the maincurrent issues in presupposition theory. These involve accommodation,which occurs when a hearer’s knowledge state is adjusted to meet thespeaker’s presuppositions; presupposition failure, which occurs when apresupposition is (known to be) false; the interaction betweenpresuppositions and attitudes; and variability in the behavior oftriggers and their presuppositions.},

I solve the problem by enriching the semantics of attitude ascriptions with some independently argued assumptions on the structure and interpretation of mental states. In particular, I propose a DRT-based representation of mental states with a global belief-layer and a variety of labeled attitude compartments embedded within it. Hence, desires and other non-doxastic attitudes are asymmetrically dependent on beliefs. I integrate these mental state representations into a general semantic account of attitude ascriptions which relies on the parasitic nature of non-doxastic attitudes to solve Karttunen’s puzzle.},

It describes a formal fragment of English suitable for the running scenario. Using this fragment the chapter illustrates the emergence of non-monotonic effects in interpretation and the interaction of ambiguity with background knowledge. The chapter then describes pragmatic interpretation of meaning as probabilistic reasoning about an informative speaker, who reasons about a literal listener. It discusses the role of semantic indices in this framework and shows that binding these indices at the pragmatic level allows us to deal with several issues in context-sensitivity of meaning, such as the interpretation of scalar adjectives.},

The common characteristics of assertions and polar questions are responsible for the fact that both allow these reactions; the differences between the two speech acts explain the different contextual effects confirming and reversing moves have depending on whether they react to an assertion or a polar question. We then examine the distribution of a set of ‘polarity’ particles in Romanian in terms of the notions defined in the rest of the paper and end with a series of predictions concerning polarity particles across languages.},

We find that models
implementing the hypothesis that presupposition projection is fundamentally discrete fit the data better than models implementing the hypothesis that it is fundamentally gradient. To evaluate the robustness of this finding, we collect three additional datasets: a replication of the original dataset, as well as two datasets that modify the methodology of the original. Across the three datasets, we again find that models implementing the discreteness hypothesis fit the data better than models implementing the gradience hypothesis. We argue that these results favor an account on which factive presuppositions are fundamentally discrete in nature, and we discuss how this discreteness might be cashed out within both classical semantic accounts of factive predicates as well as accounts of presupposition projection that tie it to the question under discussion.},

(ii) reflects the so-called T-condition of Tarski (1935, 1944). (iii) is inherent in the model-theoretic approach as persued, for example, by Montague (1974).

Two of the most challenging ones among them are the inclusion of non-declarative sentence moods and a treatment of context-dependency beyond the interpretation of tense. The present paper advances some steps in both directions since we believe that dealing with context-dependency is a prerequisite for a satisfactory treatment of interrogatives. While transformationalists tend to regard interrogatives in isolation,2 scholars interested in the semantics of natural language, both outside the Montague school (e.g., Keenan and Hull, 1973) and inside (e.g., Hamblin, 1973), have noted the relation that links up questions with their possible answers. Montague himself suggests3 that a syntax and semantics of interrogatives should provide a characterization of the semantic content of a correct answer. Whether a certain expression counts as a correct answer, however, depends on the context in which it is uttered. An appropriate context has to contain an utterance of a corresponding interrogative expression. Therefore we shall tackle the problem from the rear. First we ask: What are the expressions that may serve as answers when uttered in an appropriate context and how are they interpreted?},

@book{chierchia_meaning_1990,

	title = {Meaning and {Grammar}: {An} {Introduction} to {Semantics}},
	abstract = {This self-contained introduction to natural language semantics addresses the major theoretical questions in the field. The authors introduce the systematic study of linguistic meaning through a sequence of formal tools and their linguistic applications. Starting with propositional connectives and truth conditions, the book moves to quantification and binding, intensionality and tense, and so on. To set their approach in a broader perspective, the authors also explore the interaction of meaning with context and use (the semantics-pragmatics interface) and address some of the foundational questions, especially in connection with cognition in general. They also introduce a few of the most accessible and interesting ideas from recent research to give the reader a bit of the flavor of current work in semantics. The organization of this new edition is modular; after the introductory chapters, the remaining material can be covered in flexible order. The book presupposes no background in formal logic (an appendix introduces the basic notions of set theory) and only a minimal acquaintance with linguistics. This edition includes a substantial amount of completely new material and has been not only updated but redesigned throughout to enhance its user-friendliness.},

This model employs the cut point technique popularized by ordered logit to fit a single linear model to both continuous (0,1) and degenerate [0,1] responses. The model can be estimated with or without observations at the bounds, and as such is a general solution for these types of data. Employing a Monte Carlo simulation, I show that the model is noticeably more efficient than ordinary least squares regression, zero-and-one-inflated Beta regression, rescaled Beta regression, and fractional logit while fully capturing nuances in the outcome. I apply the model to a replication of the Aidt and Jensen (2014, European Economic Review 72, 52–75) study of suffrage extensions in Europe. The model can be fit with the R package ordbetareg to facilitate hierarchical, dynamic, and multivariate modeling.},

Since Geurts 1996, however, the promise of this research program has been called into question due to what Geurts dubs the “proviso problem”: satisfaction theory generates incorrect predictions in cases in which a presupposition ends up filtered which should not have been. I show that the satisfaction account of presupposition projection is nevertheless in good shape by revealing that the observations of Geurts are valid only under certain basic assumptions about how semantic composition works. To illustrate this, I present a satisfaction account of presupposition projection that incorporates a notion of scope-taking based on monads. The resulting composition scheme provides a setting in which the proviso problem does not arise, thus lending support to the scope theory of presupposition projection.

When outcomes take values in the intervals [0,1), (0,1], or [0,1], zero-or-one-inflated beta (zoib) regression can be used. We provide a thorough review on beta regression and zoib regression in the modeling, inferential, and computational aspects via the likelihood-based and Bayesian approaches. We demonstrate the statistical and practical importance of correctly modeling the inflation at zero/one rather than ad hoc replacing them with values close to zero/one via simulation studies; the latter approach can lead to biased estimates and invalid inferences. We show via simulation studies that the likelihood-based approach is computationally faster in general than MCMC algorithms used in the Bayesian inferences, but runs the risk of non-convergence, large biases, and sensitivity to starting values in the optimization algorithm especially with clustered/correlated data, data with sparse inflation at zero and one, and data that warrant regularization of the likelihood. The disadvantages of the regular likelihood-based approach make the Bayesian approach an attractive alternative in these cases. Software packages and tools for fitting beta and zoib regressions in both the likelihood-based and Bayesian frameworks are also reviewed.},

RSA has been shown to capture many kinds of conversational implicature, but it has been criticized as an unrealistic model of speakers, and it has so far required the manual specification of a semantic lexicon, preventing its use in natural language processing applications that learn lexical knowledge from data. We address these concerns by showing how to define and optimize a trained statistical classifier that uses the intermediate agents of RSA as hidden layers of representation forming a non-linear activation function. This treatment opens up new application domains and new possibilities for learning effectively from data. We validate the model on a referential expression generation task, showing that the best performance is achieved by incorporating features approximating well-established insights about natural language generation into RSA.},

In this paper we explore the possibility of developing a class of combinatorial semantic representations for natural languages that compute the semantic value of a (declarative) sentence as a probabilityvalue which expresses the likelihood of competent speakers of the languageaccepting the sentence as true in a given model, relative to a specificationof the world.  Such an approach to semantic representation treats the pervasive gradience of semantic properties as intrinsic to speakers’ linguisticknowledge, rather than the result of the interference of performance factors in processing and interpretation. In order for this research program to succeed, it must solve three central problems.  First, it needs to formulatea type system that computes the probability value of a sentence from thesemantic values of its syntactic constituents. Second, it must incorporate aviable probabilistic logic into the representation of semantic knowledge inorder to model meaning entailment. Finally, it must show how the specifiedclass of semantic representations can be efficiently learned.  We construct a probabilistic semantic fragment and consider how the approach that the fragment instantiates addresses each of these three issues.},

We argue for the linguistic relevance of this typology by demonstrating that the distribution and interpretation of degree modifiers is sensitive to its two major classificatory parameters: (1) whether a gradable predicate is associated with what we call an open or closed scale, and (2) whether the standard of comparison for the applicability of the predicate is absolute or relative to a context. We further show that the classification of an important subclass of adjectives within the typology is largely predictable. Specifically, the scale structure of a deverbal gradable adjective correlates either with the algebraic part structure of the event denoted by its source verb or with the part structure of the entities to which the adjective applies. These correlations underscore the fact that gradability is characteristic not only of adjectives but also of verbs and nouns, and that scalar properties are shared by categorially distinct but derivationally related expressions.*},

I begin by developing a semantic analysis of the positive form of ‘relative’ gradable adjectives, expanding on previous proposals by further motivating a semantic basis for vagueness and by precisely identifying and characterizing the division of labor between the compositional and contextual aspects of its interpretation. I then introduce a challenge to the analysis from the class of ‘absolute’ gradable adjectives: adjectives that are demonstrably gradable, but which have positive forms that relate objects to maximal or minimal degrees, and do not give rise to vagueness. I argue that the truth conditional difference between relative and absolute adjectives in the positive form stems from the interaction of lexical semantic properties of gradable adjectives—the structure of the scales they use—and a general constraint on interpretive economy that requires truth conditions to be computed on the basis of conventional meaning to the extent possible, allowing for context dependent truth conditions only as a last resort.},

In many pragmatic theories of conversational implicature, local exhaustification of such terms (‘only some’) is predicted to be difficult or impossible if the result does not entail the literal meaning, whereas grammatical accounts predict such construals to be robustly available. Recent experimental evidence supports the salience of these local enrichments, but the grammatical theories that have been argued to account for this evidence do not provide explicit mechanisms for weighting such construals against others. We propose a probabilistic model that combines previous work on pragmatic inference under ‘lexical uncertainty’ with a more detailed model of compositional semantics. We show that this model makes accurate predictions about new experimental data on embedded implicatures in both non-monotonic and downward-entailing semantic contexts. In addition, the model's predictions can be improved by the incorporation of neo-Gricean hypotheses about lexical alternatives. This work thus contributes to a synthesis of grammatical and probabilistic views on pragmatic inference.},

	abstract = {A number of recent proposals have used techniques from game theory and Bayesian cognitive science to formalize Gricean pragmatic reasoning (Frank \& Goodman, 2012; Franke, 2009; Goodman \& Stuhlmuller, 2013; Jager, 2012). We discuss two phenomena which pose a challenge to these accounts of pragmatics: M-implicatures (Horn, 1984) and embedded implicatures which violate Hurford’s constraint (Chierchia, Fox, \& Spector, 2012; Hurford, 1974). While techniques have been developed for deriving M-implicatures, Hurford-violating em- bedded implicatures pose a more fundamental challenge, because of basic limitations in the models’ architecture. In order to explain these phenomena, we propose a realignment of the division between semantic content and pragmatic content. Under this proposal, the semantic content of an utterance is not fixed independent of pragmatic inference; rather, pragmatic inference partially determines an utterance’s semantic content. We show how semantic inference can be realized as an extension to the Rational Speech Acts framework (Goodman \& Stuhlmuller, 2013). The addition of lexical uncertainty derives both M-implicatures and the relevant embedded implicatures, and preserves the derivations of more standard implicatures. We use this principle to explain a novel class of implicature, non-convex disjunctive implicatures, which have several theoretically interesting properties. In particular, these implicatures can be preserved in downward-entailing contexts in the absence of accenting, a property which is predicted by lexical uncertainty, but which violates prior generalizations in the literature (Fox \& Spector, in press; Horn, 1989).

	abstract = {A framework for pragmatic analysis is proposed which treats discourse as a game, with context as a scoreboard organized around the questions under discussion by the interlocutors. The framework is intended to be coordinated with a dynamic compositional semantics. Accordingly, the context of utterance is modeled as a tuple of different types of information, and the questions therein — modeled, as is usual in formal semantics, as alternative sets of propositions — constrain the felicitous flow of discourse. A requirement of Relevance is satisfied by an utterance (whether an assertion, a question or a suggestion) iff it addresses the question under discussion. Finally, it is argued that the prosodic focus of an utterance canonically serves to reflect the question under discussion (at least in English), placing additional constraints on felicity in context.

Based on impressionistic judgments, Beaver (2010) and Simons, Beaver, Roberts \& Tonhauser (to appear) suggested that whether the content of the complement of an utterance with a factive predicate projects depends on the information structure of the utterance and, since information structure is prosodically marked, on the prosodic realization of the utterance. This paper describes the results of three perception experiments designed to explore the influence of the prosodic realization of an utterance with a factive predicate on the projection of the content of the complement. The results of the experiments suggest that the prosodic realization of such utterances provides a cue to the projectivity of the content of the complement.

We introduce Church, a universal language for describing stochastic generative processes. Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset. The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories. Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models. We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite PCFGs, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models. Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques.},

	abstract = {Propositional attitude verbs, such as think and want, have long held interest for both theoretical linguists and language acquisitionists because their syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic properties display complex interactions that have proven difficult to fully capture from either perspective. This paper explores the granularity with which these verbs’ semantic and pragmatic properties are recoverable from their syntactic distributions, using three behavioral experiments aimed at explicitly quantifying the relationship between these two sets of properties. Experiment 1 gathers a measure of 30 propositional attitude verbs’ syntactic distributions using an acceptability judgment task. Experiments 2a and 2b gather measures of semantic similarity between those same verbs using a generalized semantic discrimination (triad or “odd man out”) task and an ordinal (Likert) scale task, respectively. Two kinds of analyses are conducted on the data from these experiments. The first compares both the acceptability judgments and the semantic similarity judgments to previous classifications derived from the syntax and semantics literature. The second kind compares the acceptability judgments to the semantic similarity judgments directly. Through these comparisons, we show that there is quite fine-grained information about propositional attitude verbs’ semantics carried in their syntactic distributions—whether one considers the sorts of discrete qualitative classifications that linguists traditionally work with or the sorts of continuous quantitative classifications that can be derived experimentally.},

Factives have traditionally been thought to presuppose the truth of their complements, but the potential need for further differentiation was present from the start, beginning with the distinction between semi-factives (e.g. discover) and ‘full’ factives (e.g. regret) by Karttunen (1971). However, the precise nature of the differences involved has remained elusive in theoretical terms, and key empirical properties have been difficult to pin down experimentally (e.g. Jayez et al. 2015). We present new experimental evidence confirming specific differences between emotive factives (be happy, appreciate) and cognitive factives (be aware, realize) using a yes/no-continuation acceptability rating task (Cummins et al., 2013). We spell out an analysis of the demonstrated contrast in terms of a distinction between triggers based on whether or not their presupposed content is encoded as part of the conventionally entailed content (Sudo, 2012; Klinedinst, 2010), and also discuss the broader theoretical implications of our experimental results.},

On our account, if P is a responsive predicate and Q a question embedded under P, then the meaning of ‘P + Q’ is, informally, “to be in the relation expressed by P to some potential complete answer to Q”. We show that this rule allows us to derive veridical and non-veridical readings of embedded questions, depending on whether the embedding verb is veridical or not, and provide novel empirical evidence supporting the generalization. We then enrich our basic proposal to account for the presuppositions induced by the embedding verbs, as well as for the generation of intermediate exhaustive readings of embedded questions (Klinedinst and Rothschild in Semant Pragmat 4:1–23, 2011).},

We introduce an NLI dataset for veridicality evaluation consisting of 1,500 sentence pairs, covering 137 unique verbs. We find that both human and model inferences generally follow theoretical patterns, but exhibit a systematic bias towards assuming that verbs are veridical–a bias which is amplified in BERT. We further show that, encouragingly, BERT's inferences are sensitive not only to the presence of individual verb types, but also to the syntactic role of the verb, the form of the complement clause (to- vs. that-complements), and negation.},

Our strategy is to investigate the nature of the lexical knowledge that a speaker of English possesses with respect to certain apparently semantically related verbs: a set of verbs that might as a first approximation be classed as verbs of removal. However, a closer examination of these apparently semantically related verbs reveals that their syntactic properties diverge. An exploration of the patterns of behavior of the verbs suggests that the initial class includes three linguistically significant subclasses. The components of meaning that are relevant to characterizing each subclass are identified by isolating those components of meaning that the members of each subclass share. The conclusion considers the implications of the meaning components identified in this study for a lexical semantic representation.},

We propose that in terms of their core, at issue content, SAVs are just like believe in expressing a doxastic attitude towards the prejacent. They differ in that they introduce a presupposition that their prejacent is contingent with respect to a distinct set of discourse alternatives that we label COUNTERSTANCES: alternative common grounds that differ only in decisions about how to resolve semantic underdetermination. The larger theoretical significance of our proposal is that it supports a characterization of 'subjective language' as an essentially pragmatic, context-sensitive phenomenon, which does not correlate with semantic type (pace Sæbø¸) but derives from speakers' recognition of the possibility of counterstance.},

In this framework, ‘outlook-based semantics’, the circumstances of evaluation are not composed of a possible world and a judge (as in ‘world-judge relativism’); rather, outlooks replace possible worlds in the role of circumstance of evaluation. Outlooks are refinements of worlds that settle not only matters of fact but also matters of opinion. Several virtues of the framework and advantages over existing implementations of world-judge relativism are demonstrated in this paper. First, world-judge relativism does not actually explain the ‘disagreement’ of ‘faultless disagreement’, while a straightforward explanation suggests itself in outlook-based semantics. Second, outlook-based semantics provides an account of subjective attitude verbs that can capture lack of opinionatedness. Third, outlook-based semantics unproblematically explains the connection-building role of aesthetic discourse and the group-relevance of discretionary assertions, while capturing the same effects in world-judge relativism obviates the purpose of the judge parameter. Finally, because the proposed circumstances of evaluation (outlooks) are entirely analogous to possible worlds, the framework is easy to use and extend.},

	abstract = {Gradable adjectives denote properties that are relativized to contextual thresholds of application: how long an object must be in order to count as long in a context of utterance depends on what the threshold is in that context. But thresholds are variable across contexts and adjectives, and are in general uncertain. This leads to two questions about the meanings of gradable adjectives in particular contexts of utterance: what truth conditions are they understood to introduce, and what information are they taken to communicate? In this paper, we consider two kinds of answers to these questions, one from semantic theory, and one from Bayesian pragmatics, and assess them relative to human judgments about truth and communicated information. Our findings indicate that Bayesian accounts can model human judgments about what is communicated better than they can model human judgments about truth conditions, and their weakness on the latter is mainly because they fall short in accurately predicting the relevant threshold distributions. We explore the possibility that the overall performance of the Bayesian accounts can be potentially improved when they are supplemented with the threshold conventions postulated by semantic theory.

We present generalisations of both computational monads and Freyd categories, which we call parameterised monads and parameterised Freyd categories, that also capture computational effects with parameters. Examples of such are composable continuations, side effects where the type of the state varies and input/output where the range of inputs and outputs varies. By considering structured parameterisation also, we extend the range of effects to cover separated side effects and multiple independent streams of I/O. We also present two typed λ-calculi that soundly and completely model our categorical definitions – with and without symmetric monoidal parameterisation – and act as prototypical languages with parameterised effects.},

We show that these facts are difficult for existing theories of evidentials, which assign evidentials necessarily widest scope, to explain. We then provide an analysis using a logical system designed to account for evidential reasoning; this logic is the first developed system of probabilistic dynamic predicate logic.

	abstract = {Whether there is a one-to-one mapping between semantic categories and their syntactic counterparts has been the subject of extensive research in linguistic theory (e.g. Grimshaw 1979; Pesetsky 1982; Sadock 1991). Degree expressions are a case study for the investigation of the extent of isomorphism in the syntax-semantics mapping. Syntactically, they are characterized either as modifiers or specifiers (Bresnan, 1973; Jackendoff, 1977), as heads (Abney, 1987; Corver, 1997), or as a mixed class of heads and adjuncts (Neeleman et al., 2004). Likewise, semantic analyses of these expressions treat them as modifiers of context-sensitive properties of individuals (Klein 1980), as operators that take a gradable meaning and return a property of individuals meaning (Kennedy \& McNally, 2005a), or as a mixed class of semantic modifiers and operators, thereby mirroring their syntactic categories (Kennedy \& McNally, 2005b).
In order to determine whether the semantic categories ascribed to degree expressions correspond to their syntactic structure, I compare their syntactic and semantic distribution crosslinguistically. Data from Hebrew, Arabic, and Korean show that degree expressions are underlyingly heads that sometimes project as heads and sometimes as adjuncts as a result of morphological and syntactic operations. In addition, I show that the semantic combinatorics proposed in Kennedy \& McNally (2005b) are borne out modulo some language-specific morphosyntactic and semantic properties.
In the latter part of the dissertation, I develop an experimental paradigm consisting of picture description tasks that aims to adjudicate between two competing analyses of gradable predicates-whether they are context-sensitive properties (Klein, 1980) or relations between individuals and degrees (Cresswell, 1976; von Stechow, 1984; Kennedy, 1997). Another goal of these experiments is to determine what the semantic properties of the intensifier very are as a representative of a class of degree modifiers that manipulate contextual parameters associated with the gradable predicate they modify. Results from two studies lend support to the degree analysis and show that very is indeed sensitive to contextual parameters, some of which are involved in the semantics of degree modifiers and some of which are not. The crosslinguistic picture that emerges includes partial isomorphism in the syntax-semantics mapping of degree expressions within predictable parameters.},

	abstract = {Four experiments investigated 4-year-olds' understanding of adjective - noun compositionality and their sensitivity to statistics when interpreting scalar adjectives. In Experiments 1 and 2, children selected tall and short items from 9 novel objects called pimwits (1 - 9 in. in height) or fromthis array plus 4 taller or shorter distractor objects of the same kind. Changing the height distributions of the sets shifted children's tall and short judgments. However, when distractors differed in name and surface features from targets, in Experiment 3, judgments did not shift. In Experiment 4, dissimilar distractors did affect judgments when they received the same name as targets. It is concluded that 4-year-olds deploy a compositional semantics that is sensitive to statistics and mediated by linguistic labels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Combining ideas of previous evolutionary and probabilistic approaches (e.g., Potts 2008; Franke 2012; Lassiter 2011; Lassiter \&amp; Goodman 2013), we propose a new model that makes exact and empirically testable probabilistic predictions about speakers' use of gradable adjectives and that derives the relative-absolute distinction from considerations of optimal language use. Along the way, we distinguish between vagueness and loose use, and argue that, within our approach, vagueness can be understood as the result of uncertainty about the exact degree distribution within the comparison class.},

Logics of vagueness including many valued logics, fuzzy logics, and supervaluation logics all provide responses in accord with this view. The thought that an adequate response might require the recognition of cases of overdetermination and truth value gluts has few supporters. This imbalance lacks justification. As it happens, Jaskowski's paraconsistent discussive logic-a logic which admits truth value gluts-can be defended by reflecting on similarities between it and the popular supervaluationist analysis of vagueness already in the philosophical literature. A simple dualisation of supervaluation semantics results in a paraconsistent logic of vagueness based on what has been termed subvaluational semantics.},

	abstract = {Both relative adjectives (RAs) like big and absolute adjectives (AAs) like empty are sensitive to the context: in the former case, the context determines how much size is required to count as big; in the latter, the context determines how much deviation from total emptiness is allowed to count as empty. Whereas it is generally agreed that the role of context with RAs is to fix the value of a threshold variable, the status of absolute adjective thresholds, and therefore the role of context in their interpretation, remains an object of debate. Some researchers have argued that all gradable adjectives have context-sensitive threshold variables that are assigned values by the same mechanisms (Lassiter \&amp; Goodman 2013). Others have claimed that AAs have fixed, endpoint-oriented meanings and that sensitivity to context arises from pragmatic reasoning about imprecision (Kennedy 2007; Syrett, Kennedy \&amp; Lidz 2009; van Rooij 2011; Burnett 2014; Qing \&amp; Franke 2014). In an eye-tracking Visual World experiment, we investigate RAs and AAs used as restrictive modifiers. We find that target identification is significantly faster for both types of adjectives when the visual context supports a restrictive interpretation of the predicate, although this effect is considerably delayed in the case of AAs. We conclude that for RAs, the target facilitation effect is driven by the lexical semantics of the predicate itself. However, it is argued that the extra processing cost observed with AAs results from pragmatic reasoning about imprecision.},

	abstract = {The Reflexivity proposal is that the English "self" anaphor marks the predicate as reflexive, not syntactically, but semantically, rendering the "self" constructions logophoric according to Reinhart \& Reuland (1993). This analysis is consistent with the fact
that the pronoun form can acceptably alternate with the "self" form. In order to reach an interpretation of a logophor or pronoun, it seems clear that access to information beyond that provided by syntax is necessary. Indeed, there is also psycholinguistic evidence to support the
view that regular reflexives are processed differently from that of logophoric "self" forms. Although both Piñango et al. (2001) and Harris et al. (2000) presented processing evidence for logophor resolution involving more than syntactic operations or some source of information
other than syntax, there is as yet, little indication of what logophor resolution does entail or the processes that it does require. The present study examines whether pragmatic, discourse information is used for the successful interpretation of a logophor and its antecedent, and how similar
the process is to pronoun coreference. As alluded to in the Piñango et al. (2001) study, logophor resolution required more computational work than reflexive binding. In the same vein, the use of a logophor may also be more costly to resolve than that of a pronoun if the emphasizing
role of a logophor requires an additional or more complex operation, such as marking the antecedent representation as emphasized or constructing a richer, more complex antecedent representation. On the other hand, logophor resolution may be much the same process as that for pronouns, with
the same types of information used to link the logophor/pronoun with its correct antecedent.},

We use speeded judgment and self-paced reading tasks to examine the comprehension of German possessive pronouns. To investigate whether native and non-native grammars differentially affect participants’ performance, we compare two groups of non-native German speakers with inverse L1–L2 distributions: a group with L1 Spanish – L2 English, and a group with L1 English – L2 Spanish. We show that the reading profiles of both groups are modulated by their L1 grammar, with L2 proficiency selectively affecting participants’ judgment accuracy but not their reading times. We propose that reading comprehension is mainly influenced by multilinguals’ native grammar, but that knowledge of an L2 grammar can further increase sensitivity to morphosyntactic violations in an additional language.},

	abstract = {The research reported here is a systematic investigation of what competent, native speakers of English, naive to contemporary syntactic theory, judge to be grammatically acceptable patterns of co-reference involving names and pronouns. Its central goal is the specification of syntactic factors that influence co-reference within and between sentences. The results show that naive subjects have consistent intuitions of grammaticality that agree with some principles of contemporary binding theory. The results also show that naive subjects diverge substantially from syntactic theorists in other judgments of grammaticality. In particular, subjects have strong intuitions that reflexives and pronouns are in complementary distribution, a fact that supports contemporary syntactic theory. Beyond that domain, subjects' judgments of co-reference in name-pronoun, name-name, and pronoun-name sequences are systematically influenced by syntactic structure in ways that are not consistent with syntactic theory. Co-reference in name-pronoun sequences is generally quite acceptable but becomes more acceptable as the syntactic prominence of the name increases. Co-reference in name-name sequences is only moderately acceptable and becomes less acceptable as the syntactic prominence of the first name increases. Co-reference in pronoun-name sequences is generally unacceptable and is only weakly influenced by the kinds of syntactic prominence that affect other relations of co-reference. We account for these results through the elaboration of a model of the process by which syntactic representations are mapped onto a representation of discourse capable of expressing generalizations about co-reference both intra-sententially and inter-sententially. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

We tested this sample with 936 naïve participants using three formal judgment tasks (magnitude estimation, 7-point Likert scale, and two-alternative forced-choice) and report five statistical analyses. The results suggest a convergence rate of 95\% between informal and formal methods, with a margin of error of 5.3–5.8\%.

Rational theories of language use have come under attack for decades for not being able to account for the seemingly irrational overinformativeness ubiquitous in referring expressions. Here we present a novel production model of referring expressions within the Rational Speech Act framework that treats speakers as agents that rationally trade off cost and informativeness of utterances. Crucially, we relax the assumption that informativeness is computed with respect to a deterministic Boolean semantics, in favor of a nondeterministic continuous semantics. This innovation allows us to capture a large number of seemingly disparate phenomena within one unified framework: the basic asymmetry in speakers’ propensity to overmodify with color rather than size; the increase in overmodification in complex scenes; the increase in overmodification with atypical features; and the increase in specificity in nominal reference as a function of typicality. These findings cast a new light on the production of referring expressions: rather than being wastefully overinformative, reference is usefully redundant.

In this review, I demonstrate the basic mechanics and commitments of RSA as well as some of its standard extensions, highlighting the key features that have led to its success in accounting for a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena. Fundamentally, it treats language as probabilistic, informativeness as gradient, alternatives as context-dependent, and subjective prior beliefs (world knowledge) as a crucial facet of interpretation. It also provides an integrated account of the link between production and interpretation.

Given that non-linguist participants are unlikely to be familiar with linguistic notations such as the use of subscripts, how can researchers indicate the coreference relation whose acceptability is being assessed? In other words, if a researcher wants to test whether a particular coindexation relation is acceptable, how can this information be conveyed to participants? Ignoring this issue can yield uninterpretable data. This chapter provides an in-depth discussion of different methods for indicating coreference when researchers want to elicit acceptability judgments from participants who are not trained linguists. The chapter also discusses other approaches relevant for anaphora, including antecedent-choice tasks and real-time methods (self-paced reading, eye-tracking), and explains how they differ in terms of the kind of data they yield and thus the kinds of hypotheses they can be used to investigate.},

	abstract = {Semantic analyses of natural language typically rely on variables for the interpretation of binding relationships. This is true of standard static setups, where sentences might denote sets of variable assignments, as well as standard dynamic ones, where they might denote relations between (sets of) variable assignments. Several well-known alternative frameworks eschew object-language variables in favor of representing semantic dependencies as functional dependencies. This obviates assignments, and has the benefit that any expression’s binding needs are discoverable directly from its type. But these popular variable-free approaches are limited to static, in-scope binding relationships, those in which dependents occur in the arguments of their binders. In this paper we develop a semantics that is variable-free in the same sense, but captures traditional notions of dynamic anaphora. We demonstrate the value of anaphoric type transparency with novel analyses of crossover, ellipsis, and sloppy/paycheck anaphora, and compare the new semantics, which introduces the notions of parameterized monads and lenses to the linguistics literature, with other list-based dynamic systems and other accounts of crossover.},

Previous work investigating syntactic attachment ambiguities has shown that discarding a locally grammatically available, but globally failing, parse is costly. However, little is known about how comprehenders cope with semantic parsing ambiguities. Using the case study of scopally ambiguous definite descriptions such as the rabbit in the big hat, we examine whether comparable penalties arise for non-lexical semantic ambiguities. In a series of reference resolution tasks, we find dispreference for strings that are globally defined but fail to refer under alternative semantic parses, compared to strings where all readings successfully refer to the same individual. Crucially, this effect is only detectable when the alternative failing reading gives rise to a REFERENTIAL GARDEN PATH, where a dynamic constraint evaluation process temporarily settles on a unique referent before eventually failing. We conclude that failing alternative readings cause dispreference for a definite description, but only when the failing interpretation constitutes a red herring.},

The questions of which adjectival constructions are evaluative and why have formed the foundation for semantic theories of these constructions and of adjectives themselves (Klein 1980, von Stechow 1984), although it has been alleged that these theories are based on an incomplete picture of the phenomenon of evaluativity (Bierwisch 1989, Rett 2008a). We present the first experimental tests of the scope and nature of evaluativity across adjectival constructions and adjective types. These studies confirm that evaluativity is conditioned by adjective type (relative or absolute, Kennedy \& McNally 2005) and is not restricted to the positive construction. However, they also show several new and surprising aspects of evaluativity: that it is perhaps better characterized as a gradable property than a binary one; that the ways in which relative and absolute adjectives differ in their evaluativity vary across construction; and that, contrary to standard intuitions, subjects are willing to attribute evaluativity to the subject position of comparative constructions like Sue is taller than Bill. We show that this last particularly surprising result reveals a lot about how subjects interpret contextually sensitive constructions, and we discuss its consequences for experimental studies and semantic theories of adjectival evaluativity as well as context-sensitive phenomena more generally.},

We provide a system, based on graded monads, that synthesizes insights from these programs by formalizing individual discourse phenomena in terms of separate effects, or grades. Included are effects for introducing and retrieving discourse referents, non-determinism for indefiniteness, and generalized quantifier meanings. We formalize the behavior of individual effects, as well as the interactions between effects, in terms of algebraic laws tailored to the relevant discourse phenomena. The system we propose is thus modular and suggests a novel approach to integrating formal accounts of distinct semantic phenomena. Finally, we give an interpretation of the system into pure \$\$ {\textbackslash}lambda \$\$-calculus that respects the laws. Future work will aim to integrate more discourse phenomena using the same methodology, for example, presupposition and conventional implicature.},

Language models are commonly viewed as an implementation of distributional semantics, as they are optimized to capture the statistical features of natural language. It is often argued that distributional semantics models should excel at capturing graded/vague meaning based on linguistic conventions, but struggle with truth-conditional reasoning and symbolic processing. We evaluate this claim with a case study on vague (e.g. "many") and exact (e.g. "more than half") quantifiers. Contrary to expectations, we find that, across a broad range of models of various types, LLMs align more closely with human judgements on exact quantifiers versus vague ones. These findings call for a re-evaluation of the assumptions underpinning what distributional semantics models are, as well as what they can capture.},

We show that the corpus frequency counts of definite comparatives sharply drop when the comparison class used for their interpretation is formed by more than two individuals. Two alternative theories of these distributional facts are considered and tested experimentally through an acceptability judgment task. According to the first theory, the 2-Individuals Theory, definite comparatives presuppose that the CC is of cardinality 2; under the second theory, the 2-Degrees Theory, the meaning of the comparative is evaluated against a granularity γ that maps the individuals in the CC to degrees in the relevant adjectival scale, and definite comparatives presuppose that the set of the degrees resulting from this mapping is of cardinality 2. Our experimental results show that definite comparative descriptions are most frequent and felicitous when evaluated against comparison classes with two individuals, but also that acceptability drops off with higher cardinalities in a gradient manner that is sensitive to granularity. Taken together, these findings argue against the 2-Individuals theory of definite comparatives and lend support to the 2-Degrees theory.},

However, classic eye-tracking studies revealed contrastive inferences with scalar and material adjectives, but not with color adjectives. This was explained as a difference in listeners’ informativity expectations, since color adjectives are often used descriptively (hence not warranting a contrastive interpretation). Here we hypothesized that, beyond these pragmatic factors, perceptual factors (i.e., the relative perceptibility of color, material and scalar contrast) and semantic factors (i.e., the difference between gradable and non-gradable properties) also affect the real-time derivation of contrastive inferences. We tested these predictions in three languages with prenominal modification (English, Hindi, and Hungarian) and found that people derive contrastive inferences for color and scalar adjectives, but not for material adjectives. In addition, the processing of scalar adjectives was more context dependent than that of color and material adjectives, confirming that pragmatic, perceptual and semantic factors affect the derivation of contrastive inferences.},

	abstract = {Many degree constructions are evaluative in the sense that they require a measure of some sort to exceed a contextually-determined norm. We assume that this inference is always an implicature (Rett, 2015b), and we develop a game-theoretic pragmatic treatment to explain how and when it arises. Our analysis is couched in a Rational Speech Act (RSA) model of communication, building on the theory of vagueness-resolution proposed in Lassiter and Goodman 2014. To extend the Lassiter and Goodman model to a wider range of degree constructions, we do two things: ?rst, we incorporate insights from Barker (2002) about the role of comparison-class uncertainty in the interpretation of gradable predicates, and second, we adapt an independent RSA model of Manner implicature (Bergen et al., 2016) to capture the effects of linguistic markedness in degree constructions (Rett, 2015b). Combining these pieces provides the ?rst gradient model of evaluativity inferences, and we conclude by discussing some of its novel predictions.},

	abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.},

	abstract = {Gradable adjectives (GAs) provide an ideal domain for evaluating theories of the interface betwen semantic interpretation and context: relative and absolute GAs are both context dependent, but absolute adjectives can have precise meanings in a way that relative adjectives cannot. We provide processing evidence for the hypothesis that imprecision in absolute adjectives is a pragmatic phenomenon: absolute thresholds are semantically scalar endpoints, and imprecise uses are derived by a global pragmatic threshold, which specifies how much deviation from literal meaning is pragmatically ignorable in a context (see e.g. Lasersohn 1999). The evidence comes from a set of visual world eye-tracking experiments adapted from the design of Sedivy, Tanenhaus, Chambers \&amp; Carlson (1999) and Aparicio, Xiang \&amp; Kennedy (2015). We measured the time-course of reference resolution in phrases of the form the Adj Noun while varying whether Adj is relative or absolute, as well as the degree to which the intended referent (target) and a competing object exemplified Adj. We found a contrast-based processing advantage for absolute GAs when the target exemplified Adj imprecisely but the competitor exemplified Adj precisely. However, this advantage was found to be sensitive to the relative/absolute distinction, as well as to the degree to which objects in the display exemplified the relevant scalar property. Collectively, our results provide evidence for a difference in the mental processes underlying relative versus absolute threshold fixing, which we argue is best modeled by a pragmatic theory of imprecision.},

	abstract = {How do young children learn the meanings of adjectives that label emotions and mental states, like happy or confident? The concepts behind these words seem easy to grasp, and yet the properties they denote are abstract and lack reliable visual correlates, much as with verbs such as think or know. There is robust evidence that the linguistic context in which mental state verbs appear supports their acquisition. Using a two-pronged approach, we explore whether the same is true for these adjectives. First, we present a comprehensive study of adjectives in child-directed speech (CDS) in CHILDES corpora, revealing that these adjectives have a unique distributional profile based on the semantics of co-occurring words, and the syntactic complements with which they appear, distinguishing them from other adjective types. Second, we present a word learning study with adults using a version of the Human Simulation Paradigm manipulating key variables from the corpus study (subject animacy and syntactic complements), while holding other features (morphosyntactic form and syntactic position of the adjective) constant. Participants’ guesses demonstrate that they recruit these cues to constrain the meaning of novel adjectives to one corresponding to an emotion or mental state. By presenting a thorough comparison of adjective types across key linguistic contexts and providing evidence that such contexts constrain adjective meaning, we systematically extend syntactic bootstrapping to the adjectival domain in a way that goes well beyond previous work, and paints a vibrant picture of what supports the acquisition of adjectives.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces two extensions to the popular PyTorch machine learning framework, TorchDynamo and TorchInductor, which implement the torch.compile feature released in PyTorch 2. TorchDynamo is a Python-level just-in-time (JIT) compiler that enables graph compilation in PyTorch programs without sacrificing the flexibility of Python. It achieves this by dynamically modifying Python bytecode before execution and extracting sequences of PyTorch operations into an FX graph, which is then JIT compiled using one of many extensible backends. TorchInductor is the default compiler backend for TorchDynamo, which translates PyTorch programs into OpenAI's Triton for GPUs and C++ for CPUs. Results show that TorchDynamo is able to capture graphs more robustly than prior approaches while adding minimal overhead, and TorchInductor is able to provide a 2.27× inference and 1.41× training geometric mean speedup on an NVIDIA A100 GPU across 180+ real-world models, which outperforms six other compilers. These extensions provide a new way to apply optimizations through compilers in eager mode frameworks like PyTorch.},

An exception is Bonini et al. (1999), who report empirical results on the use of vague predicates by Italian speakers, and take the results to count in favor of epistemicism. Yet several methodological difficulties mar their experiments; we outline these problems and devise revised experiments that do not show the same results. We then describe three additional empirical studies that investigate further claims in the literature on vagueness: the hypothesis that speakers confuse ‘P’ with ‘definitely P’, the relative persuasiveness of different formulations of the inductive premise of the Sorites, and the interaction of vague predicates with three different forms of negation.},

	title = {Semantic underspecification and its contextual resolution in the domain of degrees},
	abstract = {Many natural language expressions have context-sensitive interpretations, which can make it difficult to pin down the exact meaning of an expression. To address this challenge, it is common for semanticists to assign context-sensitive expressions underspecified meaning representations, where parts of the meanings need to be resolved in context. This naturally raises two important theoretical issues concerning their semantics/pragmatics interface: (i) How do we represent their conventional, context-invariant meaning (i.e., the semantic question)? (ii) How does context, together with the conventional meaning, determine the interpretation (i.e., the metasemantic question)? In this dissertation, I focus on the domain of degrees and argue for the generality and importance of the distinction between semantic contextual resolution mechanisms and pragmatic ones in addressing these questions. The contrast is in parallel with that between the pronouns "I" (which conventionally refers to the speaker in context) and "they" (whose referent is determined via pragmatic reasoning). Concretely, I use directional modified numerals (e.g., "up to 100") and gradable adjectives (e.g., "tall" and "full") as two case studies to argue that (a) the two contextual resolution mechanisms can be unified by a general principle of informativity-applicability trade-off, which is a quantitative generalization of the interaction between Grice's maxims of Quantity and Quality, and that (b) the way to tease them apart is by examining whether the contextual resolution of an expression is sensitive to the larger linguistic environment in which it appears. If yes, the mechanism is pragmatic, and if no, it is semantic. For directional modified numerals, the opposite inference patterns they trigger when they are unembedded and embedded under deontic modals suggest that they have a pragmatic contextual resolution mechanism. For relative and maximum gradable adjectives, I examine how they are used in definite descriptions in referential contexts and argue that, contrary to some recent proposals, their contextual resolution mechanism is in fact semantic in nature. In addition to providing a more precise and unified semantics for relative (e.g., "tall") and maximum (e.g., "full") gradable adjectives, I further examine the class of minimum gradable adjectives (e.g., "bent") and illustrate that many of them are in fact systematically ambiguous between a relative reading and a \&gt; 0 reading, which is based on a meaningful notion of zero rather than the minimum. I argue that this suggests a new taxonomy of positive forms of gradable adjectives. On the one hand, some positive forms are threshold-introducing, which include maximum and relative adjectives, together with minimum adjectives with relative readings. They share a unified semantics and their differences are explained by the different contextual parameters. On the other hand, the \&gt; 0 reading of a gradable adjective is derived in a way parallel to comparative constructions, which provides a straightforward explanation of their similarities observed in the literature},

	abstract = {I will discuss two theories about adjectives. The first theory dates from the late 1960s. It is stated in Montague (1970) and Parsons (1968). According to this theory the meaning of an adjective is a function which maps the meanings of noun phrases onto other such meanings; e.g. the meaning of clever is a function which maps the meaning of man into that of clever man, that of poodle onto that of clever poodle, etc. Predicative uses of adjectives are explained as elliptic attributive uses. Thus This dog is clever is analysed as This dog is a clever dog – or as This dog is a clever animal, or perhaps as This dog is a clever being. Which noun phrase ought to be supplied in this reduction of predicative to attributive use is in general not completely determined by the sentence itself, and to the extent that it is not, the sentence must be regarded as ambiguous.The main virtue of this doctrine is that it enables us to treat, within a precise semantical theory for a natural language – as e.g. that of Montague – adjectives in such a way that certain sentences which are, or might well be, false are not branded by the semantics as logically true. Examples of such sentences are:Every alleged thief is a thiefEvery small elephant is smallIf every flea is an animal, then every big flea is a big animal},

	abstract = {Osherson and Smith (1981, Cognition, 11, 237–262) discuss a number of problems which arise for a prototype-based account of the meanings of simple and complex concepts. Assuming that concept combination in such a theory is to be analyzed in terms of fuzzy logic, they show that some complex concepts inevitably get assigned the wrong meanings. In the present paper we argue that many of the problems O\&S discovered are due to difficulties that are intrinsic to fuzzy set theory, and that most of them disappear when fuzzy logic is replaced by supervaluation theory. However, even after this replacement one of O\&S's central problems remains: the theory still predicts that the degree to which an object is an instance of, say, “striped apple” must be less than or equal to both the degree to which it is an instance of “striped” and the degree to which it is an instance of “apple”, but this constraint conflicts with O\&S's experimental results. The second part of the paper explores ways of solving this and related problems. This leads us to suggest a number of distinctions and principles concerning how prototypicality and other mechanisms interact and which seem important for semantics generally. Prominent among these are (i) the distinction between on the one hand the logical and semantic properties of concepts and on the other the linguistic that between concepts for which the extension is determined by their prototype and concepts for which extension and prototypicality are independent.},

Recently, it has been claimed that informativity alone cannot account for all the attested interactions between adjectival meaning and context and that factors related to efficiency in the search of a referent also play an important role (Rubio-Fernández, Frontiers in Psychology, 7(153), 2016). Building on Aparicio et al. (Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory, vol. 25, 2015), this paper demonstrates that perceived informativity plays an important role in RECs, but lexical semantic properties of different adjective classes are also relevant. We present results from a Visual World eye-tracking study which shows that adjective classes differ in whether they introduce RECs, and results from an offline judgment task which show that this difference correlates to some extent with the perceived informativity of members of these classes. Color adjectives, relative adjectives and maximum standard absolute adjectives were rated as overinformative when used as modifiers in the absence of contrast, and gave rise to RECs; minimum standard absolute adjectives were not rated as overinformative when used as modifiers in the absence of contrast, and did not give rise to RECs. Taken together, our results show that perceived informativity plays an important role in RECs. We also discuss additional differences between the adjective classes which suggest that differences in lexical semantics can further contribute to differences in RECs.},

We show that our model predicts humans’ interpretation of number words with high accuracy.

	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Here we present a rational analysis of these judgments: we argue that a guess functions as a compressed encoding of the speaker's subjective probability distribution over relevant possibilities. So, a statement like `X will happen' encodes information not only about the probability of X but also, implicitly, about the probability of other possible outcomes. We test formal computational models derived from our theory, showing in four experiments that they accurately predict how people make and interpret guesses. Our account naturally explains why people dislike vacuously-correct guesses (like `Some country will win the world cup'), and it might shed light on apparently sub-optimal patterns of judgment such as the conjunction fallacy.},

It has been long observed that the context-sensitivity, vagueness and gradability features of absolute scalar predicates give rise to certain puzzles for their analysis within most, if not all, modern formal semantic frameworks. While there exist proposals for solving these puzzles within other major frameworks (such as the degree semantics framework), it has been argued that some of their aspects are particularly challenging for the analysis of absolute scalar predicates within the delineation approach. By combining insights into the relationship between context-sensitivity and scalarity from the DelS framework with insights into the relationship between tolerance/similarity relations and the Sorites paradox from Cobreros et al.’s (2012) Tolerant, Classical, Strict (TCS) framework, I propose a new logical system, called Delineation TCS (DelTCS), in which to set analyses of four classes of adjectival predicates. I argue that this new framework allows for an analysis of absolute scalar adjectives that answers these challenges for delineation-based frameworks, while still preserving the heart of the Klein-ian approach.},

First, the nature of vagueness is discussed, and contrasted with notions such as ambiguity and context dependence. After that, some reasons are given that could perhaps explain why vagueness is such a pervasive phenomenon in natural language. This is followed with a review of some more or less standard linguistic analyses of gradable adjectives. The chapter is focussed on approaches that take comparison classes into account. Because comparative constructions are ideally formed in terms of gradable adjectives, comparative ordering relations are discussed as well. It is argued that one specific ordering relation is crucial for any analysis of vagueness that wants to capture the notion of ‘tolerance’: semi-orders. A lot of attention is given to contextuallist’ approaches that want to account for the Sorites paradox, because these approaches are most popular within linguistics. In the final main section, the chapter discusses what some people have called ‘loose talk’. The main issue here is whether with loose use of language we say something that is strictly speaking false, but true enough in the particular conversational setting, or true, because the conversational setting loosens the requirements for a sentence to be true.},

The empirical focus is the use of unmodified (positive form) gradable adjectives (GAs) in definite descriptions to distinguish between two objects that differ in the degree to which they possess the property named by the adjective. We show that by 3 years of age, children are sensitive to all three varieties of context–meaning interaction and that their knowledge of this relation with the definite description is appropriately guided by the semantic representations of the GA appearing in it. These findings suggest that children's semantic representations of the GAs we investigated and the definite determiner the are adult-like and that they are aware of the consequences of these representations when relating meaning and context. Bolstered by adult participant responses, this work provides important experimental support for theoretical claims regarding the semantics of gradable predicates and the nature of different types of ‘interpretive variability’, specifically semantic context dependence v. pragmatic tolerance of imprecision.},

Aspectual verbs like stop were discussed already by Greek philosophers, proper names, Kepler, and definite descriptions, the present king of France, go back to Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell by the turn of the century. Just in the span of a few years my generation of semanticists assembled a veritable zoo of "presupposition triggers" under the assumption that they were all of the same species. Generations of students have learned about presuppositions from Stephen Levinson's 1983 book on Pragmatics that contains a list of 13 types of presupposition triggers, an excerpt of an even longer unpublished list attributed to a certain Lauri Karttunen. My task in this presentation is to come clean and show why the items on Levinson's list should not have been lumped together. In retrospect it is strange that the early writings about presupposition by linguists and even by philosophers like Robert Stalnaker or Scott Soames do not make any reference to the rich palette of semantic relations they could have learned from Frege and later from Paul Grice. If we had known Frege's concepts of Andeutung  – Grice's conventional implicature  – and Nebengedanke, it would have been easy to see that there are types of author commitment that are neither entailments nor presuppositions.},

We hereby provide the first systematic semantics for confidence reports, in addition to providing a needed modal extension to the states-based semantics of comparatives. As we show, the flexibility accorded by the Neodavidsonian implementation supports analysis of grammatical constructions with confident/confidence that might otherwise be puzzling, and it lends itself to certain natural ideas about the semantics of cross-categorial probabilistic language using, e.g., likely and probability. In the end, we sketch some immediate connections between confidence-reporting discourse (e.g., I am confident that…) and belief reports about probabilistic discourse (e.g., I think it’s likely that…).

In this paper, I present a new analysis for the predicates that select the subjunctive mood in Spanish that is based on a semantics of comparison. The main generalization proposed here is the following: in Spanish, a predicate selects the subjunctive mood in its embedded proposition if the proposition is compared to its contextual alternatives on a scale introduced by the predicate. In this proposal, predicates that select the subjunctive mood are thus analyzed as gradable predicates. Furthermore, the subjunctive mood morpheme is claimed to make a semantic contribution, namely to evaluate the contextual alternatives that are compared by the predicate. In comparing this proposal to other approaches, I show that it can more straightforwardly account for a number of properties of these predicates (entailment relations, practical inferences, and contexts with more than two alternatives). New empirical evidence for two crucial properties of the predicates that select the subjunctive mood is provided: these predicates are focus sensitive and they are gradable, two properties that follow directly from the proposal developed here. In the vast literature on mood, the link between the appearance of the subjunctive mood and these important properties has never been made before.},

	abstract = {This dissertation examines the syntax and semantics of clausal complements. It identifies semantic underpinnings for some syntactic properties of the arguments of propositional attitude verbs. The way clausal arguments compose with their embedding predicates is not uniform and semantic differences emerge from the syntactic context clausal arguments appear in. Three case studies are taken up: clausal arguments of nouns, dislocated clausal arguments (sentential subjects and topics), and infinitival complements with overt subjects (AcI constructions). Chapter Two assembles evidence to support Stowell’s (1981) claim that the clausal complements of nouns are modifiers. It is shown that the clausal complements of nouns behave like adjuncts in their ability to bleed condition C (Kuno 2004 and Jacobson 2003, and explored here further). The compositional strategy used to compose attitude nouns with their arguments, following Kratzer (2006), is shown to account for this behavior and to be commensurate with observations made by Grimshaw (1990). I then show how the modifier status of clausal complements of nouns is determined by the way in which nominals are formed from clause-taking verbs. Chapter Three examines another complementation strategy, found with fronted clauses. New data from binding is provided in support of Koster’s (1978) hypothesis that clauses do not move. Specifically, fronted clauses fail to show the effects of syntactic reconstruction. An analysis, making crucial use of de re attitude ascription, is offered to account for ‘apparent’ binding into fronted clauses. Chapter Four makes the case for enriching the meanings of clausal complements. By examining some new patterns with accusative with infinitive (AcI) constructions (such as I see him to be a fool), I argue for decomposing certain doxastic attitude verbs, putting the introduction of alternatives into the complement. Here too the role of de re attitude ascription is shown to play a crucial role. It is argued that AcI constructions involve de re attitude ascription, with added constraints (determined by the lexical content of the embedding verb) on the nature of the Acquaintance Relation (Kaplan 1968, Lewis 1979). Several predictions about the kinds of verbs that can participate in AcI are borne out.},

	abstract = {This dissertation contributes to the growing tradition of work in which detailed exploration of understudied languages informs formal semantic and syntactic theory and probes the tension between crosslinguistic grammatical variation and crosslinguistic commonality in communicative goals. The dissertation focuses on two topics in Navajo (Diné Bizaad): (i) attitudes of 'thinking' and 'desiring' and (ii) the expression of adjectival meaning and degree constructions. The first part of the dissertation presents the methodological and linguistic background for the rest of the dissertation. Chapter 1 discusses the project of crosslinguistic semantic research and fieldwork methodology. Chapter 2 gives a broad introduction to the Navajo language and the literature which has explored it. The second part of the dissertation focuses on the expression of attitudes in Navajo. Chapter 3 presents an empirically rich description of the morphological, syntactic, and semantic characteristics of Navajo sentences that report distinct attitudes of 'thinking' and 'desiring' despite containing the same attitude verb, nisin Chapter 4 argues that the meaning of the embedded clause --- not nisin --- determines what attitude is reported. The exploration of Navajo is guided by investigation of English and German attitude reports begun by Kratzer (2006, 2013a) and developed by Moulton (2009, 2015). These authors develop a fully compositional account that presents an alternative to familiar verb-driven analyses of attitude reports; in their account, key aspects of the semantics of attitude reports come from material in the embedded clause. It is argued here that Navajo is a limiting case within the empirical landscape explored by Kratzer and Moulton, in which the attitude verb only determines the attitude holder. The third part of the dissertation (Chapter 5) builds on work published as Bogal-Allbritten (2013) and investigates the syntax and semantics of Navajo adjectival expressions and degree constructions, e.g. comparative and equative constructions. Chapter 5 argues that while all Navajo adjectival expressions have the same semantic type, their syntactic structure differs depending on the morphology they bear. The proposed syntactic heterogeneity explains differences in degree constructions which contain adjectival expressions of different morphological shapes.},

Researchers who pursue experimental research are often asked about the theoretical consequences of their work. Such questions generally equate “theoretical” with theories at a specific high level of abstraction, guided by the questions of traditional linguistic theory. These theories focus on the structural representation of sentences in terms of discrete units, without regard to order, time, finer-grained memory encoding, or the neural circuitry that supports linguistic computation. But there is little need for the high-level descriptions to have privileged status. There are interesting theoretical questions at all levels of analysis. A common experience is that we embark on a project guided by its apparent relevance to high-level theoretical debates. And then we discover new theoretical questions at lower levels of analysis that we had not been aware of previously. We illustrate this using examples from many different lines of experimental research.},

To match this update mechanism, we present a complete dynamic logic of information change with a probabilistic character.

The methods used are sometimes explicitly probabilistic and sometimes not. Previously, there were assumed to be clear boundaries among probabilistic frameworks, classifiers in machine learning, and distributional approaches, but these boundaries have been blurred.

	title = {Transsentential {Meditations}; {Ups} and downs in dynamic semantics},
	url = {https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/1958/},
	abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with a number of fundamental,
theoretical and empirical issues in the dynamic semantics of
natural language. In dynamic semantics, the meaning of a sentence
is not represented in isolation, but in terms of the ability to 
change certain states.

Dekker gives a type-theoretical formulation of 
Groenendijk and Stokhof's dynamic Montague grammar
(\{{\textbackslash}em DMG\}). He uses an extensional language with  a
modeltheoretic interpretation, which gives a compositional account of
discourse theoretical results, such as intersentential 
anaphoric relations between indefinite expressions and anaphoric
pronouns.

The second chapter presents an analysis of anaphoric relations in 
natural language that are outside the more traditional
discourse representation and dynamic paradigms. Dekker proposes
two important general changes: (i) structural sentence type lifting 
and (ii) a sophisticated form of dynamic negation.
One of the advantages of the resulting system is that it can be
reformulated in terms of the original system with a number of closing
operations. 

The third chapter shows that the resulting system is derivable
from the most simple Montagovian interpretation system, with the
use of existing type-changing rules associated with an 
appropriate interpretation. Therefore, this simple system might be
better than the system proposed in the previous chapter. 

Therefore, in chapter 4, \{{\textbackslash}em DMG\} is again the primary system.
Dekker shows that dynamic techniques, developed to account for
intersentential meaning relations, are well-suited for 
intrasentential relations, in particular the specification of
implicit arguments. Analyses of relational nomina, adverbial
modifiers, and temporal relations are reformulated with the
use of existential disclosure, a kind of reversed
existential closure.

The last chapter takes dynamic
predicate logic \{{\textbackslash}em DPL\} as a starting point, and presents
an `update' semantics for this system. The resulting system
presents interpretation of a sentence as an update function of
information states, more specifically, partial information about
(partial) objects. This system is extended with 
quantificational expressions, adnominal as well as adverbial.},

	abstract = {Stalnaker (1978) made two seminal claims about presuppositions. The most influential one was that presupposition projection is computed by a pragmatic mechanism based on a notion of ‘local context’. Due to conceptual and technical difficulties, however, the latter notion was reinterpreted in purely semantic terms within ‘dynamic semantics’ (Heim 1983). The second claim was that some instances of presupposition generation should also be explained in pragmatic terms. But despite various attempts, the definition of a precise ‘triggering algorithm’ has remained somewhat elusive. We discuss possible extensions of both claims. First, we offer a reconstruction of ‘local contexts’ which circumvents some of the difficulties faced by Stalnaker’s original analysis. We preserve the idea that local contexts are computed by a pragmatic mechanism that aggregates the information that follows from an incomplete sentence given the global context; but we crucially rely on a modified notion of entailment (‘R-entailment’), whose plausibility should be assessed on independent grounds. Second, we speculate that local contexts might prove necessary (though by no means sufficient) to understand how some presuppositions are triggered. In a nutshell, we suggest that a presupposition is triggered when the semantic contribution of an expression to its local context is in some sense ‘heterogeneous’. Without giving an analysis of the latter notion, we note that this architecture implies that presuppositions should be triggered on the basis of the meaning that an expression has relative to its local context (what we call its ‘local meaning’); we sketch some possible consequences of this analysis.},

Given evidence that the triggers of these implications are not anaphoric, hence do not impose presuppositional constraints on their local contexts, we argue that the projection behavior of these implications cannot be explained by the standard Karttunen/Heim/van der Sandt proposals. But we recognize that parallels between the projection behavior of these implications and the projection behavior of anaphorically-triggered implications must be explained. The current account offers a unified explanation of why the predicates in question give rise to projection at all; why projection of these implications is susceptible to contextual suppression; and why projection is systematically filtered in the standard Karttunen filtering environments, despite the absence of contextual constraints. We demonstrate that our account largely makes the same predictions for filtering of anaphoric and non-anaphoric presuppositions, and briefly support the claim that in the case of disjunction, filtering in the two cases is not fully parallel, as predicted by our account. We also briefly discuss how the well-documented variability in projection across predicates in the same semantic class can be understood within our approach.},

This way of thinking offers a new perspective on diverse phenomena, including the projection of presuppositions, association with focus, contrastive topic marking, and variability of projection behavior.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The past 15 years have seen increasing experimental investigations of core pragmatic questions in the ever more active and lively field of experimental pragmatics. Within experimental pragmatics, many of the core questions have relied on the operationalization of the theoretical notion of “implicature rate.” Implicature rate based results have informed the work on acquisition, online processing, and scalar diversity, inter alia. Implicature rate has typically been quantified as the proportion of “pragmatic” judgments in two-alternative forced choice truth value judgment tasks. Despite its theoretical importance, this linking hypothesis from implicature rate to behavioral responses has never been extensively tested. Here we show that two factors dramatically affect the “implicature rate” inferred from truth value judgment tasks: (a) the number of responses provided to participants; and (b) the linking hypothesis about what constitutes a “pragmatic” judgment. We argue that it is time for the field of experimental pragmatics to engage more seriously with its foundational assumptions about how theoretical notions map onto behaviorally measurable quantities, and present a sketch of an alternative linking hypothesis that derives behavior in truth value judgment tasks from probabilistic utterance expectations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Investigations of linguistic meaning rely crucially on truth-value judgments, which assess whether a sentence can truthfully describe a given scenario. In investigations of language acquisition, truth-value judgments are used to assess both the target knowledge adults have and the developing knowledge children have at different ages. On the basis of truth-value judgments, researchers have concluded that differences between how children resolve ambiguous utterances and how adults do so persist until at least age five. Current explanations compatible with the experimental data attribute these differences to both grammatical processing and pragmatic factors. Here, we use computational cognitive modeling to formally articulate one hypothesis about the ambiguity-resolution process that underlies child and adult judgments in a truth-value judgment task; crucially, the model can separate out the individual contributions of specific grammatical processing and pragmatic factors to the resulting judgment behavior. We find that pragmatic factors play a larger role than grammatical processing factors in explaining children’s non-adult-like ambiguity resolution behavior. Interestingly, the model predicts qualitative similarity between child and adult ambiguity resolution. Given this prediction, we then extend our model to show how the same processes may be active in adult ambiguity resolution. This result supports continuity in the development of ambiguity resolution, where children do not qualitatively change how they resolve ambiguity in order to become adult-like. We discuss the implications of our results for acquisition more generally, including both theories of development and methods for assessing that development, as well as the generalizability of this model of ambiguity resolution beyond the specific cases we consider.},

  abstract =      {The question of whether humans represent grammatical
                   knowledge as a binary condition on membership in a
                   set of well-formed sentences, or as a probabilistic
                   property has been the subject of debate among
                   linguists, psychologists, and cognitive scientists
                   for many decades. Acceptability judgments present a
                   serious problem for both classical binary and
                   probabilistic theories of grammaticality. These
                   judgements are gradient in nature, and so cannot be
                   directly accommodated in a binary formal grammar.
                   However, it is also not possible to simply reduce
                   acceptability to probability. The acceptability of a
                   sentence is not the same as the likelihood of its
                   occurrence, which is, in part, determined by factors
                   like sentence length and lexical frequency. In this
                   paper, we present the results of a set of large-scale
                   experiments using crowd-sourced acceptability
                   judgments that demonstrate gradience to be a
                   pervasive feature in acceptability judgments. We then
                   show how one can predict acceptability judgments on
                   the basis of probability by augmenting probabilistic
                   language models with an acceptability measure. This
                   is a function that normalizes probability values to
                   eliminate the confounding factors of length and
                   lexical frequency. We describe a sequence of modeling
                   experiments with unsupervised language models drawn
                   from state-of-the-art machine learning methods in
                   natural language processing. Several of these models
                   achieve very encouraging levels of accuracy in the
                   acceptability prediction task, as measured by the
                   correlation between the acceptability measure scores
                   and mean human acceptability values. We consider the
                   relevance of these results to the debate on the
                   nature of grammatical competence, and we argue that
                   they support the view that linguistic knowledge can
                   be intrinsically probabilistic.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling of phrase structure grammars has yielded many results of benefit to linguists in their investigation of these grammars, such as Chomsky's characterization in terms of self-embedding of those context-free languages which are not regular. The recent shift of focus in linguistic theory to transformational grammars has not been accompanied by a similar application of mathematical techniques to transformations. Our present purpose is to foster such studies by providing general definitions which model grammatical transformations as mappings on trees (equivalently, labeled bracketings) and investigating questions of current linguistic interest, such as the recursiveness of languages generated by transformational grammars. The first result of our research is that, despite the linguistically motivated, complex restrictions placed on transformational grammars, every recursively enumerable set of strings is a transformational language (Theorem 5.1). We demonstrate that this power of transformational grammars to generate non-recursive languages results from their ability to cycle their rules, applying transformations an unbounded number of times (Corollary 6.6). Analysis of decision procedures for grammars with bounded cycling reveals a connection between the amount of cycling permitted by a grammar and the complexity of the recursive set it generates; if cycling is bounded by any elementary recursive function (primitive recursive function, function in ∄n for n {\textgreater} 3), then the language generated has characteristic function in the same class (Corollary 6.7). One application of these results provides empirical support for the notion that natural languages are recursively, in fact elementarily, decidable. Our results also isolate one feature which must be further restricted in a linguistically motivated way if transformational theory is to achieve its goal of delimiting precisely the natural languages.},

  abstract = {A lively research field has recently emerged that uses experimental methods to probe the linguistic behaviour of modern deep networks. While work in this tradition often reports intriguing results about the grammatical skills of deep nets, it is not clear what their implications for linguistic theorising should be. As a consequence, linguistically oriented deep net analysis has had very little impact on linguistics at large. In this chapter, I suggest that deep networks should be treated as theories making explicit predictions about the acceptability of linguistic utterances. I argue that if we overcome some obstacles standing in the way of seriously pursuing this idea, we will gain a powerful new theoretical tool, complementary to mainstream algebraic approaches.},
