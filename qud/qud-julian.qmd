# Modeling the prompt in inference judgment tasks

# Some implementation details

## Delta rules

# Outlook

## Other empirical domains

### Conventional implicatures (e.g., parentheticals)

### Evidentials (e.g., Sarah Murray's work)

### Non-canonical questions (e.g., Kyle Rawlins's work)

#### 'what if', resistance and resolution in discourse, epistemic resistance moves

### Socio-semantic inferences (e.g., Andrea Beltrama's work)

## Other kinds of experimental tasks

### Dynamics of imprecision (project with Yifan and Helena)

## Other uses of the framework

### Relating operational semantics of lambda-terms to response behavior (e.g., psychosemantics of 'most')
