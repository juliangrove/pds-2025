### Predicate-specific patterns

Not all predicates show the same degree of discreteness. We can examine the posterior distributions of the factivity parameter by predicate:

Several patterns emerge from these posterior distributions. Canonical factives like *know* and *discover* show high probability of being interpreted with factive presupposition across models, while non-factives like *think* and *say* show consistently low probability. The most interesting cases are variable predicates like *confirm* and *prove*, which show intermediate probabilities with high uncertainty. This variation suggests that while factivity is discrete at the token level (each use involves either a factive or non-factive interpretation), predicates differ systematically in their propensity to trigger factive interpretations.

### Context effects

The norming study reveals how world knowledge varies across contexts:

![Density plots of the posterior log-odds certainty (with participant intercepts zeroed out) for three items in @degen_prior_2021's norming task (experiment 2a). Low and high priors are for *Grace visited her sister*, given the facts *Grace hates her sister* and *Grace loves her sister*, respectively. Mid prior is for *Sophia got a tattoo*, given the fact *Sophia is a hipster*.](plots/norming_3_thetas.png){#fig-norming-contexts}

The separation between low and high prior contexts validates the experimental manipulationâ€”participants genuinely use world knowledge when judging likelihood. This makes the discrete-factivity model's success more impressive: it must overcome this continuous variation to produce discrete projection patterns.
