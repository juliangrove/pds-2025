To evaluate these competing hypotheses, we can examine their empirical predictions. Using [the same model comparison techniques from adjectives](../adjectives/adjectives-aaron.html#comparing-models), we compute expected log pointwise predictive densities (ELPDs).

### Posterior predictive checks

First, let's visualize how well each model captures the distribution of responses:

Empirical distributions are represented by density histograms of data from @degen_prior_2021.](plots/contentful_all_6_pp.png){#fig-factivity-posteriors}

@fig-factivity-posteriors reveals striking differences between the models:

- **Discrete-factivity** (top left): Captures the characteristic dips in response frequency mid-scale—reflecting its mixture of factive (response ≈ 1) and non-factive (response varies) interpretations
- **Wholly-gradient** (bottom left): Produces smoother, unimodal distributions, unable to capture the multi-modal patterns in the data
- **Wholly-discrete** (top right): Forces responses to extremes, missing the intermediate values
- **Discrete-world** (bottom right): Shows some bimodality but in the wrong direction

The discrete-factivity model's ability to capture the non-monotonic response patterns is particularly clear for predicates like *announce* and *confirm*, where responses cluster both near 1 (factive interpretation) and at intermediate values (non-factive interpretation modulated by world knowledge).

### Quantitative comparison

Looking at the expected log pointwise predictive densities reveals a clear winner. The discrete-factivity model substantially outperforms all alternatives across the board. Compared to the wholly-gradient model, it achieves a ΔELPD of 834.5 ± 55.4—a massive improvement in predictive accuracy. The advantages over discrete-world (ΔELPD = 766.1 ± 53.8) and wholly-discrete (ΔELPD = 295.1 ± 34.8) models are similarly impressive. These differences are not just statistically significant but practically large, indicating that the discrete-factivity model provides a dramatically better account of the data.
