### Separating world knowledge from factivity

A key challenge in studying factivity is that our judgments about whether someone is certain of a proposition depend on two factors:

1. The properties of the predicate (whether speakers interpret it as being associated with a presupposition)
2. Our world knowledge about how likely the proposition is

@degen_prior_2021 developed a two-stage experimental design to tease these apart:

**Stage 1: Norming study (Experiment 2a)**

First, they measured how world knowledge affects belief in various propositions. Participants saw items like:

:::{.callout-note title="Norming item example"}
**Fact**: Sophia is a hipster.  
**Question**: How likely is it that Sophia got a tattoo?  
**Response**: [slider from 0 to 1]
:::

For each proposition (e.g., *Sophia got a tattoo*), they created two contextsâ€“one making it more likely (Sophia is a hipster) and one making it less likely (*Sophia is a Mormon*). This gives us a measure of world knowledge independent of any embedding predicate.

**Stage 2: Projection study (Experiment 2b)**

Next, they embedded these same propositions under various predicates and asked about the speaker's certainty:

:::{.callout-note title="Projection item example"}
**Context**: Isabella said that Sophia is a hipster.  
**Utterance**: Noah knows that Sophia got a tattoo.  
**Question**: Is Noah certain that Sophia got a tattoo?  
**Response**: [slider from 0 to 1]
:::

They reasoned that, if speakers categorically interpret *know* as triggering a factive presupposition, Noah should be certain regardless of the prior probability; but, they reasoned, if projection is gradient, his certainty should vary with world knowledge.

### Key experimental details

The experiments tested 20 predicates that theory suggests might pattern differently:

- **Canonical factives:** *be annoyed*, *discover*, *know*, *reveal*, *see*
- **Non-factives:**
  - **Non-veridical non-factive:** *pretend*, *say*, *suggest*, *think* 
  - **Veridical non-factive:** *be right*, *demonstrate*
- **Optionally factive:** *acknowledge*, *admit*, *announce*, *confess*, *confirm*, *establish*, *hear*, *inform*, *prove* 

Each participant saw 20 items (one per predicate) plus controls, with predicates paired with different complement clauses and prior contexts across participants.
