The type system presented in above included types for entities, truth values, and types formed from these.
PDS is inspired by the presentation in @grove_probabilistic_2023, who illustrate how a semantics incorporating Bayesian reasoning can be encoded using a λ-calculus with such a frugal type system;
however, whereas @grove_probabilistic_2023 represent probabilistic reasoning using continuations, we employ a somewhat more abstract presentation by incorporating a new type constructor ($\P$).
In addition, we add a type $r$ to represent real numbers, for the following new set of atomic types.

$$
A \Coloneqq e ∣ t ∣ r
$$

Then, the full (and final) set of types can be given as follows.

$$
\mathcal{T}_{A} \Coloneqq A ∣ \mathcal{T}_{A} → \mathcal{T}_{A} ∣ \mathcal{T}_{A} × \mathcal{T}_{A} ∣ ⋄ ∣ \P \mathcal{T}_{A}
$$

In Haskell

```haskell
-- | Atomic types for entities, truth values, and real numbers.
data Atom = E | T | R deriving (Eq, Show)

-- | Arrows, products, and probabilistic types, as well as type variables for
-- encoding polymorphism.
data Type = At Atom
          | Type :→ Type
          | Unit
          | Type :× Type
          | P Type
          | TyVar String
  deriving (Eq)
```

Types of the form $\P α$ are inhabited by *probabilistic programs* that represent probability distributions over values of type $α$.
For example, a program of type $\P t$ represents a probability distribution over truth values (i.e., a [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution)); 
a program of type $\P e$ represents a probability distribution over entities (e.g., a [categorical distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution});
a program of type $\P r$ represents a probability distribution over real numbers (e.g., a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution));
and a program of type $\P (e → t)$ represents a probability distribution over functions from entities to truth values.
Given the new inventory of probabilistic types, probabilistic programs are typed as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$Γ ⊢ t : α$}
\RightLabel{$\mathtt{Return}$}\UnaryInfC{$Γ ⊢ \pure{t} : \P α$}
\end{prooftree}
& \begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$Γ ⊢ t : \P α$}
\AxiomC{$Γ, x : α ⊢ u : \P β$}
\RightLabel{$\mathtt{Bind}$}\BinaryInfC{$Γ ⊢ \left(\begin{array}{l} x ∼ t \\ u\end{array}\right) : \P β$}
\end{prooftree}
\end{array}
$$

Thus there are to constructors that can be used to produce typed probabilistic programs;
we call these '*return*', and '*bind*'.
The $\mathtt{Return}$ rule effectively turns any value $t$ into a [degenerate distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_distribution);
i.e., a probability distribution all of whose probability mass is assigned to the value $t$.
We denote this distribution by wrapping the relevant value in an orange box, as shown.
Meanwhile, the $\mathtt{Bind}$ rule allows one to compose probabilistic programs together.
Given some program $t$, one can sample a value ($x$) from $t$ and then keep going with the program $u$.
We describe some of the interactions between return and bind in a little more detail (and with some illustrative examples) next.

We also upgrade our λ-terms in Haskell to reflect these constructors:

```haskell
-- | Untyped λ-terms. Types are assigned separately (i.e., "extrinsically").
data Term = Var VarName           -- Variables.
          | Con Constant          -- Constants.
          | Lam VarName Term      -- Abstractions.
          | App Term Term         -- Applications.
          | TT                    -- The 0-tuple.
          | Pair Term Term        -- Pairing.
          | Pi1 Term              -- First projection.
          | Pi2 Term              -- Second projection.
          | Return Term           -- Construct a degenerate distribution.
          | Let VarName Term Term -- Sample from a distribution and continue.
```
Here, the bind operator is notated using `Let`:
`Let x t u` is to be read as

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x ∼ t \\
u
\end{array}
$$

## The probability monad

Importantly, the map $\P$ from types to types is defined to be a *monad*.
The typing rules given above feature one rule corresponding to each of two different *monadic operators*:
$\mathtt{Return}$ (an introduction rule) and $\mathtt{Bind}$ (an elimination rule).^[
  See \cite{bernardy_bayesian_2022}, where similar rules are presented in a somewhat more refined, dependently typed setting.
]
As a monad, $\P$ (together with return and bind) should satisfy the following *monad laws*;
i.e., the following equalities---*Left identity*, *Right identity*, and *Associativity*---should be supported:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\textit{Left identity} & \textit{Right identity} & \textit{Associativity} \\[1mm]
\begin{array}{l}
x ∼ \pure{v} \\
k
\end{array}\ \ =\ \ k[v/x] 
& \begin{array}{l}
x ∼ m \\
\pure{x}
\end{array}\ \ =\ \ m 
& \begin{array}{l}
y ∼ \left(\begin{array}{l}
x ∼ m \\
n
\end{array}\right) \\
o
\end{array}\ \ =\ \ \begin{array}{l}
x ∼ m \\
y ∼ n \\
o
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

These provide tight constraints on the behavior probabilistic programs.
Left identity says that sampling a value from a degenerate distribution (via return and bind) is trivial:
it can only result in the single value that the degenerate distribution assigns all of its mass to.
The law encodes this fact by allowing one to simply continue with rest of the relevant probabilistic program ($k$, whatever that may be), but with the returned value $v$ substituted for the sampled value $x$. 

What Right identity says is sort of symmetrical:
sampling a value from a program $m$ and immediately returning that value as new degenerate distribution is *also* trivial;
you can always get rid of this extra step.

Finally, Associativity says that sampling a value ($y$) from a complex probabilistic program is the same as sampling it from the distribution defined in the final step of this program.
For example, if one has one normal distribution parameterized by a value sampled from another,

$$
\begin{array}{l}
y ∼ \left(\begin{array}{l}
x ∼ \abbr{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\abbr{Normal}(x, 1)
\end{array}\right) \\
o
\end{array}
$$

one can always pull out the parts of this complex distribution to yield a series of bind statements:

$$
\begin{array}{l}
x ∼ \abbr{Normal}(0, 1) \\
y ∼ \abbr{Normal}(x, 1) \\
o
\end{array}
$$

## Some examples

We can recruit return and bind to characterize complex probability distributions.
To illustrate, suppose we have some categorical distribution, $\ct{mammal}: \P e$, on mammals.
We can represent a distribution on mammals' mothers as in (@ex-mother).

(@ex-mother)
$$
\begin{array}[t]{l}
x ∼ \ct{mammal}\\
\pure{\ct{mother}(x)}
\end{array}
$$

Here, a random entity $x: e$ is *sampled* from $\ct{mammal}: \P e$ using bind, and then $\ct{mother}(x): e$ is returned, as indicated by the orange box.
Since return turns things of type $α$ into probabilistic programs of type $\P α$, the resulting probabilistic program is of type $\P e$.
Furthermore, assuming that the probability distribution $\ct{mammal}$ only has support on (i.e., assigns non-zero probability to) the entities which are mammals, the distribution which results will only have support on the entities which are the mothers of entities which are mammals.

### Reweighting distributions

Our probabilistic language also comes with an operator $\ct{factor}$ for scaling probability distributions according to some weight.^[
  We define $\ct{factor}$ here as a primitive of the language of probabilistic programs (i.e., a constant).
  In their continuation-based treatment, \cite{grove_probabilistic_2023} implement $\ct{factor}$ so that it has the scaling behavior described only informally here.
  One could (if they wanted to) interpret the current system into one that uses continuations, so that $\ct{factor}$ has the behavior needed.
]

(@ex-factor)
$$\ct{factor} : r → \P ⋄$$

For instance, we may constrain our "mother" distribution so that it assigns more weight to the mothers of mammals which are hungrier.

(@ex-hungry-mother)
$$\begin{array}[t]{l}
x ∼ \ct{mammal} \\
\ct{factor}(\ct{hungry}(x)) \\
\pure{\ct{mother}(x)}
\end{array}$$

Here, $\ct{hungry} : e → r$ maps entities onto degrees representing how hungry they are.
Thus the program above represents a probability distribution over entities which assigns non-zero probabilities only to entities which are the mother of some mammal, and which assigns greater probabilities to entities the hungrier their children are.

### Making observations

In terms of $\ct{factor}$, we may define another function, $\ct{observe}$.

(@ex-observe)
$$
\begin{align*}
\ct{observe}\ \ &:\ \ t → \P ⋄ \\
\ct{observe}(p)\ \ &=\ \ \ct{factor}(𝟙(p))
\end{align*}
$$

$\ct{observe}$ takes a truth value and either keeps or throws out the distribution represented by the expression which follows it, depending on whether this truth value is $\True$ or $\False$.
This is accomplished by factoring a distribution by the value of an indicator function ($𝟙$) applied to the truth value.^[
  See @grove_probabilistic_2023 for further details.
]

(@ex-indicator)
$$
\begin{align*}
𝟙\ \ &:\ \ t → r \\
𝟙(\True)\ \ &=\ \ 1 \\
𝟙(\False)\ \ &=\ \ 0
\end{align*}
$$

For instance, we may instead constrain our "mother" program to describe a distribution over only dogs' mothers.

(@ex-dog-mother)
$$
\begin{array}[t]{l}
x ∼ \ct{mammal} \\
\ct{observe}(\ct{dog}(x)) \\
\pure{\ct{mother}(x)}
\end{array}
$$

This distribution assigns a probability of $0$ to any entity which is not the mother of some dog.
Indeed, we could use both $\ct{factor}$ and $\ct{observe}$ to define another distribution which assigns a probability of $0$ to any entity which is not the mother of some dog, and which assigns greater probabilities to mothers of hungrier dogs.

(@ex-hungry-dog-mother)
$$
\begin{array}[t]{l}
x ∼ \ct{mammal} \\
\ct{factor}(\ct{hungry}(x)) \\
\ct{observe}(\ct{dog}(x)) \\
\pure{\ct{mother}(x)}
\end{array}
$$

## Typing constants in Haskell

The implemented system relies on a [Hindley-Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system)-style type inference algorithm that finds any λ-term's principal type---i.e., the most general polymorphic type it can have, given its structure and the types of any constants it contains.
We omit the full algorithm here to save space, but it's still useful to illustrate how constants are assigned types.
In general, we rely on *signatures* to type constants, i.e., partial functions from constants to types:

```haskell
-- | Assign types to constants.
type Sig = Constant -> Maybe Type
```
For example, a signature that assigns the appropriate types to $\ct{observe}$ and $\ct{factor}$, as well as constants formed out of `Double`s, is the following one (note that the following syntax requires the `LambdaCase` Haskell language extension):

```haskell
t, r :: Type
t = At T
r = At R

tau :: Sig
tau = \case
  Left  "factor"  -> Just (r :→ P Unit)
  Left  "observe" -> Just (t :→ P Unit)
  Right _         -> Just r
```
It may be useful to think about how `tau` could be extended to accommodate the other expressions mentioned above.
