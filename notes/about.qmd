This site contains materials for [a course](https://juliangrove.github.io/nasslli-2025/) on *Probabilistic dynamic semantics* given by [Julian Grove](http://juliangrove.github.io/) and [Aaron Steven White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/) at [NASSLLI 2025](https://nasslli25.shane.st/), held at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) from June 23–27, 2025. 

## About the instructors

[Julian Grove](http://juliangrove.github.io/) is a postdoctoral researcher in [Linguistics](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/) at the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/) and a member of the [Formal and Computational Semantics lab](http://factslab.io/) (FACTS.lab).
He is interested in combining computational tools from Bayesian data analysis and programming language theory and bringing them to semantics.
He will be an Assistant Professor of Semantics and Computational Linguistics at the [University of Florida](https://lin.ufl.edu/) starting in August, 2025.

[Aaron Steven White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/) is an Associate Professor of [Linguistics](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) at the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/), where he directs the [Center for Language Sciences](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/cls/) and the [Formal and Computational Semantics lab](http://factslab.io/) (FACTS.lab).
[His research](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/research) investigates the relationship between linguistic expressions and conceptual categories that undergird the human ability to convey information about possible past, present, and future configurations of things in the world.
