This site contains materials for [a course](https://juliangrove.github.io/nassli-2025/) on *Probabilistic dynamic semantics* given by [Julian Grove](http://juliangrove.github.io/) and [Aaron Steven White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/) at [NASSLLI 2025](https://nasslli25.shane.st/), held at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) from June 23â€“27, 2025. 

## About the instructors

[Julian Grove](http://juliangrove.github.io/) is a postdoctoral researcher in [Linguistics](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/) at the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/) and a member of the [Formal and Computational Semantics lab](http://factslab.io/) (FACTS.lab).
He is interested in bringing computational tools from Bayesian data analysis and programming language theory to type-theoretic natural language semantics.
He will be an Assistant Professor of Semantics and Computational Linguistics at the [University of Florida](https://lin.ufl.edu/) starting in August, 2025.

[Aaron Steven White](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/) is an Associate Professor of [Linguistics](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/lin/) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/) at the [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu/), where he directs the [Center for Language Sciences](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/cls/) and the [Formal and Computational Semantics lab](http://factslab.io/) (FACTS.lab).
[His research](http://aaronstevenwhite.io/research) investigates the relationship between linguistic expressions and conceptual categories that undergird the human ability to convey information about possible past, present, and future configurations of things in the world.
