To illustrate how PDS bridges formal semantics and experimental data, we'll examine two case studies that exemplify different aspects of the framework.

### Case Study 1: Vagueness and Gradable Adjectives

Vague predicates provide an ideal starting point because everyone agrees they involve gradient uncertainty. Expressions like *tall*, *expensive*, and *old* lack sharp boundaries—there's no precise height at which someone becomes tall [@lakoff_hedges_1973; @sadock_truth_1977; @lasersohn_pragmatic_1999; @krifka_approximate_2007; @solt_vagueness_2015].

Formal semantic theories have long recognized this gradience. Degree-based approaches [@klein_semantics_1980; @bierwisch_semantics_1989; @kamp_two_1975; @kennedy_projecting_1999; @kennedy_scale_2005; @kennedy_vagueness_2007; @barker_dynamics_2002] analyze gradable adjectives as expressing relations to contextual thresholds:

- *tall* is true of $x$ if $\ct{height}(x) \geq d_\text{tall}$ (context)

The threshold $d_\text{tall}$ varies with context—what counts as tall for a basketball player differs from tall for a child. But even within a fixed context, speakers show gradient judgments about borderline cases.

This makes vagueness ideal for demonstrating how PDS works. The framework can:
- Maintain the compositional degree-based analysis from formal semantics
- Add probability distributions over thresholds to capture gradient judgments
- Model how context shifts these distributions
- Link threshold distributions to slider scale responses

Recent experimental work reveals additional complexity. Different adjective types show distinct patterns:
- **Relative adjectives** (*tall*, *wide*): Maximum gradience in positive form
- **Absolute adjectives** (*clean*, *dry*): Different threshold distributions
- **Minimum vs. maximum standard**: Asymmetric patterns of imprecision

These patterns both support and refine formal theories, showing how experimental data can advance theoretical understanding. Recent years have seen partial integration into computational models [@lassiter_context_2013; @qing_gradable_2014; @kao_nonliteral_2014; @lassiter_adjectival_2017; @bumford_rationalizing_2021]. We'll show that PDS allows us to synthesize and compare these different partial approaches.

### Case Study 2: Factivity and Projection

While vagueness involves expected gradience, factivity presents a puzzle. Traditional theory treats factivity as discrete—predicates either trigger presuppositions or they don't [@kiparsky_fact_1970; @karttunen_observations_1971].^[We'll spend a lot of time on Day 4 saying exactly what we mean by discrete here. @karttunen_observations_1971, of course, classically argues that there are predicates that sometimes trigger presuppositions and sometimes don't. For our purposes, we'll say that this behavior is discrete in the sense that it's more like ambiguity than vagueness. That is, we'll show that uncertainty around factivity displays the hallmarks of resolved uncertainty.] Yet experimental data reveals pervasive gradience.

A predicate is *factive* if it triggers inferences about its complement that project through entailment-canceling operators. []{#exm-love-positive} []{#exm-love-negative} []{#exm-love-question} *Love* appears factive because *Mo left* is inferrable from the standard family of sentences in (@exm-love-positive)–(@exm-love-question):

(@exm-love-positive) Jo loves that Mo left.
(@exm-love-negative) Jo doesn't love that Mo left.  
(@exm-love-question) Does Jo love that Mo left?

But when @white_role_2018 (discussed above) and @degen_are_2022 collected projection judgments at scale, they found continuous variation [@xue_correlation_2011; @smith_projection_2011; @djarv_prosodic_2017 also observe similar patterns]. Qualitatively, @degen_are_2022 argue that there is no clear line separates factive from non-factive predicates. Mean projection ratings vary continuously from *pretend* (lowest) to *be annoyed* (highest).

![Aggregate factivity measures from @degen_are_2022, showing continuous variation in projection ratings across predicates under questioning.](plots/projection_no_fact_means.pdf){width=750}

This gradience poses a theoretical challenge [@simons_observations_2007; @simons_what_2010; @simons_best_2017; @tonhauser_how_2018]. 

@kane_intensional_2022 later showed that this gradience is likely due to task effects. They demonstrate that when one applies a clustering model to these data that accounts for noise due to various factors, many of the standard subclasses of factives pop out. Some of these subclasses–e.g. the cognitive factives, which @karttunen_observations_1971 observes to not always give rise factivity–appear to themselves be associated with non-necessary factive inferences. 

In this case study, we'll focus on understanding what gives rise to this gradience. We'll consider two hypotheses that PDS allows us to state precisely and test against the data collected by @degen_prior_2021, which uses the same experimental paradigm as @degen_are_2022:

**The Fundamental Discreteness Hypothesis**: Factivity remains discrete; gradience reflects:
- Multiple predicate senses (factive and non-factive variants)
- Structural ambiguity affecting projection [@varlokosta_issues_1994; @giannakidou_polarity_1998; @giannakidou_affective_1999; @giannakidou_dependency_2009; @roussou_selecting_2010; @farudi_antisymmetric_2007; @abrusan_predicting_2011; @kastner_factivity_2015; @ozyildiz_attitude_2017]
- Contextual variation in whether complements are at-issue [@simons_best_2017; @roberts_preconditions_2024; @qing_rational_2016]

**The Fundamental Gradience Hypothesis**: No discrete factivity property exists. Gradient patterns reflect different degrees to which predicates support complement truth inferences [@tonhauser_how_2018].

PDS allows us to implement both hypotheses formally and test their predictions against fine-grained response distributions—not just means, but entire judgment patterns including multimodality that might indicate mixture distributions. We'll show how this approach can be applied to judgment data aimed at capturing factivity using various experimental paradigms [@tonhauser_prosodic_2016; @djarv_prosodic_2017; @djarv_cognitive_2018; @white_role_2018; @white_lexicosyntactic_2018; @white_believing_2021; @degen_prior_2021; @degen_are_2022; @jeong_prosodically-conditioned_2021; @kane_intensional_2022].
