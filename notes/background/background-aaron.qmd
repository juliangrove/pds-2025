# The Bridge from Theory to Data: Understanding Adequacy in Linguistic Theory

Semantic theory has achieved remarkable success in characterizing the compositional structure of natural language meaning. Through decades of careful theoretical work, semanticists have developed elegant formal systems that capture how complex meanings arise from the systematic combination of simpler parts. These theories explain two fundamental types of judgments that speakers make: *acceptability judgments* about whether strings are well-formed, and *inference judgments* about what follows from what speakers say.

The field now stands at an exciting juncture. The rise of large-scale experimental methods and computational modeling opens new opportunities to test and refine these theoretical insights against rich behavioral data. The challenge—and opportunity—is to connect our elegant formal theories to the messy, gradient patterns we observe when hundreds of speakers make thousands of judgments. How can we maintain the theoretical insights that formal semantics has achieved while extending them to account for this new empirical richness?

Probabilistic Dynamic Semantics (PDS) aims to provide a systematic bridge between these theoretical insights and behavioral data. It takes the compositional analyses developed using traditional Montagovian methods and maps them to probabilistic models that can be quantitatively evaluated against experimental results. The goal is not to replace traditional semantics but to extend its reach, allowing us to test theoretical predictions at unprecedented scale while maintaining formal rigor.

## Traditional Semantic Methodology: Foundations of Success

Semanticists study the systematic relationships between linguistic expressions and the inferences they support. The field's methodology centers on two types of judgments:

**Acceptability judgments** assess whether strings are well-formed relative to a language and context [@schütze_gramaticality_2016]. []{#exm-comitative-good} []{#exm-coordination-bad} In a context where a host asks what a guest wants with coffee, (@exm-comitative-good) is clearly acceptable, while (@exm-coordination-bad) is not [@ross_constraints_1967; @sprouse_island_2021]:

(@exm-comitative-good) What would you like with your coffee?
(@exm-coordination-bad) #What would you like and your coffee?

**Inference judgments** assess relationships between strings [@davis_semantics_2004]. []{#exm-love-antecedent} []{#exm-veridicality-inference}  When speakers hear (@exm-love-antecedent), they typically infer (@exm-veridicality-inference) [@white_lexically_2019]:

(@exm-love-antecedent) Jo loved that Mo left.
(@exm-veridicality-inference) Mo left.

### Observational Adequacy

A core desideratum for semantic theories is *observational adequacy* [@chomsky_current_1964]: for any string $s \in \Sigma^*$, we should predict how acceptable speakers find it in context, and for acceptable strings $s, s'$, we should predict whether speakers judge $s'$ inferable from $s$.

Achieving observational adequacy requires mapping vocabulary elements to abstractions that predict judgments parsimoniously. These abstractions may be discrete or continuous, simple or richly structured. Through careful analysis of consistent inference patterns, semanticists have identified powerful generalizations.

For instance, examining predicates like *love*, *hate*, *be surprised*, and *know*, theorists observed they all give rise to inferences about their complement clauses that survive under negation and questioning. This led to positing the abstraction FACTIVE—a property that predicts systematic inferential behavior across diverse predicates [@kiparsky_fact_1970; @karttunen_observations_1971].

### Descriptive Adequacy and Theoretical Depth

Beyond observational adequacy lies *descriptive adequacy*: capturing data "in terms of significant generalizations that express underlying regularities in the language" [@chomsky_current_1964, p. 63]. This drive for deeper explanation motivates the field's emphasis on parsimony and formal precision.

The history of generative syntax illustrates two approaches to achieving descriptive adequacy:

1. **Analysis-driven**: Start with observationally adequate analyses in expressive formalisms, then extract generalizations as constraints
2. **Hypothesis-driven**: Begin with constrained formalisms (like CCG or minimalist grammars) and test their empirical coverage

The hypothesis-driven approach, which PDS adopts for semantics, aims to delineate phenomena through representational constraints. This becomes crucial when developing models that both accord with theoretical assumptions and can be evaluated quantitatively [@baroni_proper_2022; @pavlick_symbols_2023].

### The Power and Natural Boundaries of Traditional Methods

This methodology has yielded profound insights into semantic composition, scope phenomena, discourse dynamics, and the semantics-pragmatics interface. By focusing on carefully constructed examples and native speaker intuitions, theorists have uncovered deep regularities in how meaning is constructed and interpreted.

Yet every methodology has natural boundaries. Traditional semantic methods excel at identifying patterns and building theories but face practical constraints when we ask: How well do our generalizations, based on examining 5-10 predicates, extend to the thousands of predicates in the lexicon? What factors beyond semantic knowledge influence the judgments we observe? And how exactly does abstract semantic knowledge produce concrete behavioral responses?

## The Experimental Turn: New Opportunities for Semantic Theory

The traditional methodology's success has created a foundation solid enough to support exciting new extensions. Experimental semantics brings the tools of behavioral experimentation to bear on questions about meaning, allowing us to test and refine theoretical insights at unprecedented scale.

### Scaling Semantic Investigation

Where traditional methods might examine a handful of predicates, experimental approaches can investigate entire lexical domains. Extending our example involving the verb *love*: English has thousands of similar clause-embedding predicates, each potentially varying in its inferential properties. We can now test whether generalizations based on canonical examples extend across these vast lexicons.

The MegaAttitude datasets [@white_computational_2016; @white_role_2018; @white_lexicosyntactic_2018; @white_frequency_2020; @an_lexical_2020; @moon_source_2020; @kane_intensional_2022] exemplify this approach, collecting inference judgments for hundreds of predicates across multiple inference types. This scale reveals patterns invisible to traditional methods—subtle distinctions between near-synonyms, unexpected predicate clusters, and systematic variation across semantic domains.

### Teasing Apart Contributing Factors

Experimental methods allow us to investigate the rich array of factors that influence inference judgments:

- **Semantic knowledge**: The core meanings of expressions
- **World knowledge**: Prior beliefs about plausibility  
- **Contextual factors**: The discourse context and QUD
- **Individual differences**: Variation in how speakers interpret expressions
- **Response strategies**: How participants use rating scales

Rather than viewing these as confounds, we can see them as windows into the cognitive processes underlying semantic interpretation. For instance, @degen_prior_2021 systematically manipulated world knowledge to show how prior beliefs modulate the strength of factive inferences, revealing the interplay between semantic and pragmatic factors.

### Making Linking Hypotheses Explicit

Perhaps most importantly, experimental approaches force us to make explicit what traditional methods leave implicit: the link between semantic representations and behavioral responses [@jasbi_linking_2019; @waldon_modeling_2020]. When we say speakers judge that an inference follows, what cognitive processes produce that judgment? How do abstract semantic representations map onto slider scale responses?

This is not merely a methodological detail—it's a substantive theoretical question. Different linking hypotheses make different predictions about response patterns, allowing us to test not just our semantic theories but our assumptions about how those theories connect to behavior.

## Understanding Gradience: A Taxonomy of Uncertainty

One of the most striking findings from experimental semantics is the pervasiveness of gradient judgments. While semanticists have long recognized the existence of graidence in some domains–e.g. gradable adjectives–we often assume categorical distinctions in other domains–e.g. factivity. And where traditional approaches often assume categorical distinctions, experimental data reveals continuous variation. Understanding this gradience is crucial for developing theories that connect formal semantics to behavioral data.

### Two Fundamental Types of Uncertainty

The framework we'll explore distinguishes two types of uncertainty that can produce gradient judgments:

```
Sources of Gradience in Inference Judgments
├── Resolved (Type-Level) Uncertainty
│   ├── Ambiguity
│   │   ├── Lexical (e.g., "run" = locomote vs. manage)
│   │   ├── Syntactic (e.g., attachment ambiguities)
│   │   └── Semantic (e.g., scope ambiguities)
│   └── Discourse Status
│       └── QUD (Question Under Discussion)
└── Unresolved (Token-Level) Uncertainty
    ├── Vagueness (e.g., threshold for "tall")
    ├── World knowledge (e.g., likelihood facts are true)
    └── Task effects
        ├── Response strategies
        └── Response error
```

### Resolved Uncertainty: Multiple Discrete Possibilities

Resolved uncertainty arises when speakers must choose among discrete interpretations. []{#exm-uncle-running} Consider:

(@exm-uncle-running) My uncle is running the race.

The verb "run" is ambiguous—the uncle might be a participant (locomotion) or the organizer (management). Asked "How likely is it that my uncle has good managerial skills?", participants who interpret "run" as locomotion might respond near 0.2, while those interpreting it as management might respond near 0.8. The population average might be 0.5, but this reflects a *mixture* of discrete interpretations, not genuine gradience.

This uncertainty is "resolved" because once speakers fix an interpretation, the inference follows determinately. The gradience emerges from averaging across different resolutions, not from uncertainty within any single interpretation.

### Unresolved Uncertainty: Gradient Within Interpretations

Unresolved uncertainty persists even after fixing all ambiguities. []{#exm-uncle-tall} Consider:

(@exm-uncle-tall) My uncle is tall.

Even with no ambiguity about "tall"'s meaning, speakers remain uncertain whether the uncle exceeds any particular height threshold. This is classic vagueness—the predicate's application conditions are inherently gradient [@fine_vagueness_1975; @graff_shifting_2000; @kennedy_vagueness_2007; @van_rooij_vagueness_2011; @sorensen_vagueness_2023].

World knowledge creates another layer: even knowing someone runs races (locomotion sense), we remain uncertain about their speed, endurance, or likelihood of finishing. These uncertainties appear within individual trials, not just across participants.

### Why This Distinction Matters

The type of uncertainty has profound implications for semantic theory:

- **Resolved uncertainty** suggests discrete semantic representations with probabilistic selection
- **Unresolved uncertainty** suggests gradient representations or probabilistic reasoning within fixed meanings

Different phenomena may involve different uncertainty types. As we'll see, vagueness clearly involves unresolved uncertainty (everyone agrees "tall" lacks sharp boundaries), while factivity's gradience is more puzzling—is it resolved uncertainty from ambiguous predicates, or unresolved uncertainty in projection itself?

## Case Studies: Testing Semantic Theory at Scale

To illustrate how PDS bridges formal semantics and experimental data, we'll examine two case studies that exemplify different aspects of the framework.

### Case Study 1: Vagueness and Gradable Adjectives

Vague predicates provide an ideal starting point because everyone agrees they involve gradient uncertainty. Expressions like *tall*, *expensive*, and *old* lack sharp boundaries—there's no precise height at which someone becomes tall [@lakoff_hedges_1973; @sadock_truth_1977; @lasersohn_pragmatic_1999; @krifka_approximate_2007; @solt_vagueness_2015].

Formal semantic theories have long recognized this gradience. Degree-based approaches [@klein_semantics_1980; @bierwisch_semantics_1989; @kamp_two_1975; @kennedy_projecting_1999; @kennedy_scale_2005; @kennedy_vagueness_2007; @barker_dynamics_2002] analyze gradable adjectives as expressing relations to contextual thresholds:

- *tall* is true of x if height(x) ≥ d<sub>tall</sub>(context)

The threshold d<sub>tall</sub> varies with context—what counts as tall for a basketball player differs from tall for a child. But even within a fixed context, speakers show gradient judgments about borderline cases.

This makes vagueness ideal for demonstrating how PDS works. The framework can:
- Maintain the compositional degree-based analysis from formal semantics
- Add probability distributions over thresholds to capture gradient judgments
- Model how context shifts these distributions
- Link threshold distributions to slider scale responses

Recent experimental work reveals additional complexity. Different adjective types show distinct patterns:
- **Relative adjectives** (*tall*, *wide*): Maximum gradience in positive form
- **Absolute adjectives** (*clean*, *dry*): Different threshold distributions
- **Minimum vs. maximum standard**: Asymmetric patterns of imprecision

These patterns both support and refine formal theories, showing how experimental data can advance theoretical understanding. Recent years have seen partial integration into computational models [@lassiter_context_2013; @qing_gradable_2014; @kao_nonliteral_2014; @lassiter_adjectival_2017; @bumford_rationalizing_2021].

### Case Study 2: Factivity and Projection

While vagueness involves expected gradience, factivity presents a puzzle. Traditional theory treats factivity as discrete—predicates either trigger presuppositions or they don't [@kiparsky_fact_1970; @karttunen_observations_1971]. Yet experimental data reveals pervasive gradience.

A predicate is *factive* if it triggers inferences about its complement that project through entailment-canceling operators. []{#exm-know-positive} []{#exm-know-negative} []{#exm-know-question} *Know* appears factive because "Mo left" is inferred from all of:

(@exm-know-positive) Jo knows that Mo left.
(@exm-know-negative) Jo doesn't know that Mo left.  
(@exm-know-question) Does Jo know that Mo left?

But when @white_role_2018 and @degen_are_2022 collected projection judgments at scale, they found continuous variation [@xue_correlation_2011; @smith_projection_2011; @djarv_prosodic_2017 also observe similar patterns]. No clear line separates factive from non-factive predicates. Mean projection ratings vary continuously from *pretend* (lowest) to *be annoyed* (highest).

![Aggregate factivity measures from MegaVeridicality dataset, showing continuous variation in projection ratings across predicates under positive and negative environments](images/veridicality_factivity.pdf){width=500}

This gradience poses a theoretical challenge [@simons_observations_2007; @simons_what_2010; @simons_best_2017; @tonhauser_how_2018]. Two hypotheses compete:

**The Fundamental Discreteness Hypothesis**: Factivity remains discrete; gradience reflects:
- Multiple predicate senses (factive and non-factive variants)
- Structural ambiguity affecting projection [@varlokosta_issues_1994; @giannakidou_polarity_1998; @giannakidou_affective_1999; @giannakidou_dependency_2009; @roussou_selecting_2010; @farudi_antisymmetric_2007; @abrusan_predicting_2011; @kastner_factivity_2015; @ozyildiz_attitude_2017]
- Contextual variation in whether complements are at-issue [@simons_best_2017; @roberts_preconditions_2024; @qing_rational_2016]

**The Fundamental Gradience Hypothesis**: No discrete factivity property exists. Gradient patterns reflect different degrees to which predicates support complement truth inferences [@tonhauser_how_2018].

PDS allows us to implement both hypotheses formally and test their predictions against fine-grained response distributions—not just means, but entire judgment patterns including multimodality that might indicate mixture distributions. This approach has been applied to factivity data from various experimental paradigms [@tonhauser_prosodic_2016; @djarv_prosodic_2017; @djarv_cognitive_2018; @white_role_2018; @white_lexicosyntactic_2018; @white_believing_2021; @degen_prior_2021; @degen_are_2022; @jeong_prosodically-conditioned_2021; @kane_intensional_2022].

## The Need for New Frameworks

These case studies illustrate what we need from a framework connecting formal semantics to experimental data:

**Maintain Compositionality**: Theories must derive complex meanings compositionally, preserving insights from decades of formal semantic research. We cannot abandon compositionality just because judgments are gradient.

**Model Uncertainty Explicitly**: The framework must represent both types of uncertainty—resolved ambiguities and unresolved gradience—and show how they interact during interpretation.

**Make Linking Hypotheses Precise**: We need explicit theories of how semantic representations produce behavioral responses. What cognitive processes intervene between computing a meaning and moving a slider?

**Enable Quantitative Evaluation**: Theories must make testable predictions about response distributions, not just average ratings. Different theories should be comparable using standard statistical metrics.

As we'll see in the next section, existing computational approaches like Rational Speech Act (RSA) models attempt to bridge formal semantics with probabilistic reasoning [@frank_predicting_2012; @goodman_knowledge_2013]. While valuable, these approaches face challenges in maintaining the modularity that makes formal semantic theories powerful. This motivates the development of Probabilistic Dynamic Semantics—a framework that preserves semantic insights while adding the probabilistic tools needed to model gradient behavioral data.
