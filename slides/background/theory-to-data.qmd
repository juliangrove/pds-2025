## The traditional view of meaning

- Compositionality: explains how lexical knowledge gives rise to patterns of inference.

### Challenges

- Inference judgments arise from multiple causal factors, only one of which is semantic knowledge.
- Traditional methodologies focus on small areas of the lexicon to support a given analysis (on the order of tens of examples), jeopardizing generalizations' validity.

---

## Semantic theory's success

Decades of careful theoretical work have developed elegant formal systems that capture:

- How complex meanings arise from systematic combination of simpler parts
- Two fundamental types of speaker judgments:
  - **Acceptability judgments**: whether strings are well-formed
  - **Inference judgments**: what follows from what speakers say

::: {.fragment}
The field now stands at an exciting juncture—new experimental methods and computational modeling offer opportunities to test theories at unprecedented scale.

## Traditional semantic methodology

### Two types of judgments

**Acceptability judgments**: assess whether strings are well-formed in context

::: {.smaller}
- What would you like with your coffee? ✓
- #What would you like and your coffee? ✗
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Inference judgments**: assess relationships between strings

::: {.smaller}
- Jo loved that Mo left. ⟹ Mo left.
:::
:::

---

## Observational adequacy

A core desideratum: predict acceptability and inference patterns for any string

- Requires mapping vocabulary to abstractions that predict judgments parsimoniously
- Abstractions may be discrete or continuous, simple or richly structured

::: {.fragment}
Through careful analysis, semanticists have identified powerful generalizations:

- Predicates like *love*, *hate*, *be surprised*, *know* share properties
- Their inferences survive under negation and questioning
- Led to positing shared theoretical properties
:::

---

## Descriptive adequacy

Beyond observational adequacy: capturing data "in terms of significant generalizations that express underlying regularities"

::: {.fragment}
Two approaches:

1. **Analysis-driven**: Start with observationally adequate analyses, extract constraints
2. **Hypothesis-driven**: Begin with constrained formalisms, test empirical coverage
:::

::: {.fragment}
PDS adopts the hypothesis-driven approach for semantics.
:::

---

## Power and boundaries

Traditional methods have yielded profound insights:

- Semantic composition
- Scope phenomena  
- Discourse dynamics
- Semantics-pragmatics interface

::: {.fragment}
### Natural boundaries

- How well do generalizations from 5-10 predicates extend to thousands?
- What factors beyond semantic knowledge influence judgments?
- How does abstract knowledge produce concrete behavioral responses?
:::

---

## Experimental semantics and pragmatics

- Methodologies like inference judgment tasks provide a way of studying larger areas of the lexicon, potentially improving the validity of semantic generalizations.

### Challenges

- Generally, unclear how modeling constructs relate to semantic theory; i.e., what lexical semantic property is implicated and how it interacts with language-external factors.
- In the setting of entire datasets, this question becomes one about gradience: what theoretical constructs underlie the relevant distributions of judgments?
  - Thus little progress on the first challenge for the traditional view.

---

## The experimental turn

Experimental semantics brings behavioral experimentation to questions about meaning.

### Scaling semantic investigation

- Traditional methods: handful of predicates
- Experimental approaches: entire lexical domains
- Example: MegaAttitude project
  - Hundreds of predicates
  - Multiple contexts and inference types
  - Reveals subtle patterns difficult to see traditionally

---

## Teasing apart contributing factors

Experimental methods investigate multiple factors influencing inference judgments:

- **Semantic knowledge**: core meanings of expressions
- **World knowledge**: prior beliefs about plausibility
- **Contextual factors**: discourse context and QUD
- **Individual differences**: variation in interpretation
- **Response strategies**: how participants use rating scales

::: {.fragment}
Rather than confounds, these are windows into cognitive processes underlying semantic interpretation.
:::

---

## Making linking hypotheses explicit

Experimental approaches force us to make explicit:

- The link between semantic representations and behavioral responses
- What cognitive processes produce judgments?
- How do abstract representations map onto scale responses?

::: {.fragment}
This is a substantive theoretical question—different linking hypotheses make different predictions about response patterns.
:::

---

## Understanding gradience

One striking finding: the pervasiveness of gradient judgments

- Even where traditional approaches assume categorical distinctions
- Examples: gradable adjectives (expected) vs. factivity (puzzling)

::: {.fragment}
Understanding gradience is crucial for theories connecting formal semantics to behavioral data.
:::

---

## A taxonomy of uncertainty

Two fundamental types producing gradience:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
```
Sources of Gradience
├── Resolved (Type-Level) Uncertainty
│   ├── Ambiguity
│   │   ├── Lexical (e.g., "run" = locomote vs. manage)
│   │   ├── Syntactic (e.g., attachment ambiguities)
│   │   └── Semantic (e.g., scope ambiguities)
│   └── Discourse Status
│       └── QUD (Question Under Discussion)
└── Unresolved (Token-Level) Uncertainty
    ├── Vagueness (e.g., height threshold for "tall")
    ├── World knowledge (e.g., likelihood of facts)
    └── Task effects
        ├── Response strategies
        └── Response error
```
:::

---

## Resolved uncertainty

Multiple discrete possibilities—speakers choose among interpretations

**Example**: "My uncle is running the race"
- *run* = locomotion or management?
- "How likely is it that my uncle has good managerial skills?"
  - Locomotion interpretation → ~0.2
  - Management interpretation → ~0.8
  - Population average → ~0.5 (mixture of discrete interpretations)

::: {.fragment}
Uncertainty is "resolved" because once interpretation is fixed, inference follows determinately.
:::

---

## Unresolved uncertainty

Persists even after fixing all ambiguities

**Example**: "My uncle is tall"
- No ambiguity about *tall*'s meaning
- Speakers uncertain about height threshold
- Classic vagueness—inherently gradient application conditions

::: {.fragment}
World knowledge creates another layer: even knowing someone runs races, uncertainty remains about speed, endurance, likelihood of finishing.
:::

---

## Why this distinction matters

Type of uncertainty has profound implications:

- **Resolved uncertainty** → discrete representations with probabilistic selection
- **Unresolved uncertainty** → gradient representations or probabilistic reasoning within fixed meanings

::: {.fragment}
Different phenomena may involve different types:
- Vagueness: unresolved (inherently uncertain application)
- Factivity: puzzling—resolved ambiguity or unresolved projection?
:::

---

## Case studies: Testing theory at scale

Two case studies exemplifying different aspects of the framework:

### Case Study 1: Vagueness and gradable adjectives
- Ideal starting point—everyone agrees they involve gradient uncertainty
- *tall*, *expensive*, *old* lack sharp boundaries

### Case Study 2: Factivity and projection
- Traditional theory treats as discrete
- Experimental data reveals pervasive gradience
- A theoretical puzzle

---

## Case Study 1: Vagueness

Formal theories have long recognized gradience in adjectives:

**Degree-based approaches**:
- *tall* is true of $x$ if height($x$) $≥ d_{\text{tall}}$(context)
- Threshold varies with context
- Even within fixed context, gradient judgments about borderline cases

::: {.fragment}
Recent experimental work reveals additional complexity:
- **Relative adjectives** (*tall*, *wide*): maximum gradience
- **Absolute adjectives** (*clean*, *dry*): different threshold distributions
- **Minimum vs. maximum standard**: asymmetric patterns
:::

---

## Case Study 2: Factivity

Traditional theory: predicates either trigger presuppositions or they don't

**Example**: *love* appears factive
- Jo loves that Mo left. ⟹ Mo left.
- Jo doesn't love that Mo left. ⟹ Mo left.
- Does Jo love that Mo left? ⟹ Mo left.

::: {.fragment}
### The puzzle

@white_role_2018 and @degen_are_2022 found continuous variation:
- No clear line between factive and non-factive predicates
- Mean projection ratings vary continuously
- *pretend* (lowest) to *be annoyed* (highest)
:::

---

## Factivity: Two hypotheses

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](images/veridicality_factivity.pdf){width=400}
:::

**Fundamental Discreteness**: Factivity discrete; gradience from:
- Multiple predicate senses
- Structural ambiguity
- Contextual variation

**Fundamental Gradience**: No discrete property exists
- Gradient degrees of complement truth support

---

## The need for new frameworks

These case studies illustrate what we need:

**Maintain Compositionality**
- Derive meanings compositionally
- Preserve formal semantic insights
- Can't abandon compositionality for gradience

::: {.fragment}
**Model Uncertainty Explicitly**
- Represent resolved and unresolved uncertainty
- Show how they interact during interpretation
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Make Linking Hypotheses Precise**
- Explicit theories of representation → behavior
- What processes intervene between meaning and slider?
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Enable Quantitative Evaluation**
- Testable predictions about response distributions
- Different theories comparable using standard metrics
:::

---

## Moving forward

Existing computational approaches (e.g., RSA) attempt to bridge formal semantics with probabilistic reasoning.

::: {.fragment}
### Challenges with existing approaches

- Face difficulties maintaining modularity
- Often blur semantics/pragmatics distinction
- Connection to traditional theory somewhat opaque
:::

::: {.fragment}
This motivates Probabilistic Dynamic Semantics—a framework that:
- Preserves semantic insights
- Adds probabilistic tools for gradient behavioral data
- Maintains theoretical commitments while enabling quantitative tests
:::

---

## Summary

- Traditional semantics has achieved remarkable success
- Experimental methods open new opportunities
- Gradience poses theoretical challenges
- Need frameworks that bridge theory and data
