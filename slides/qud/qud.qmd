## Main questions

- How do people represent their knowledge of factivity: is its gradience metalinguistic or occasional? 

![](/images/factivity_paper.png)
![](/images/factivity_qr.png)
\textcite{grove_factivity_2024}:
gradience in factivity is like ambiguity, \emph{not} vagueness. 

- How should we capture the fine-grained semantics of the prompt used in eliciting judgments?

- How does manipulating and modeling the prompt affect our earlier findings?

## Experiments
Two experiments, differing only by the prompt used. \\[0pt]
Following the paradigm of \textcite{degen_prior_2021}. \\[0pt]
 
\alert{Fact (which Nancy knows):} Zoe is 5 years old. / Zoe is a math major.
[Nancy asks:]{.gb-orange} ``Does Tim know that Zoe calculated the tip?''


- [Experiment 1:]{.gb-orange} How [certain is Nancy]{.gb-orange} that Zoe calculated the tip?
- [Experiment 2:]{.gb-orange} How \alert{likely is it that Nancy is certain} that Zoe calculated the tip?

## Experiment 1: the ``how certain'' task


![](/images/zoe_2a.png)

 

- Start with a prior distribution over \emph{discourse states}. \\[0pt]

Update with \(⟦\textit{Zoe is a math major}⟧\). \\[0pt]

Update with \(⟦\textit{Tim knows that Zoe calculated the tip}⟧\). 
- Push \(⟦\textit{How certain is Nancy that Zoe calculated the tip?}⟧\) onto the QUD stack.
- Pop it off the QUD stack; respond with maximally informative answer.

## Semantics of \emph{`how certain is X that p'}

- Assumption: while \emph{likely} predicates of degrees on a probability scale, \emph{certain} predicates of degrees on a [confidence]{.gb-orange} scale \autocite{klecha_positive_2012}.
- In practice, the scale associated with \emph{certain} is truncated at the lower end, relative to the scale for \emph{likely}.

## Experiment 2: the ``how likely \ldots{} certain'' task

![](/images/zoe_2b.png)

- Start with a prior distribution over \emph{discourse states}. \\[0pt]

Update with \(⟦\textit{Zoe is a math major}⟧\). \\[0pt]

Update with \(⟦\textit{Tim knows that Zoe calculated the tip}⟧\). 
- Push \(⟦\textit{How likely is it that N is certain that Z calculated the tip?}⟧\) onto the QUD stack.
- Pop it off the stack; respond.

## Semantics of \emph{`how likely is it that X is certain that p'}

- Assumption: \emph{certain} gives rise to a vague standard threshold, and thus \emph{occasional} uncertainty.  \\[0pt]
\emph{likely} computes the probability of the vague inference. 
- Perhaps, more appropriate to think of this standard as being \emph{imprecise} rather than \emph{vague}\ldots{}.  \\[0pt]
assuming \emph{certain} is a maximum standard adjective (see, e.g., \textcite{kennedy_scale_2005,kennedy_vagueness_2007}).

## Outlook


- Building on \textcite{grove_factivity_2024}, we continue to find that inferences from factive predicates exhibit gradience which is metalinguistic in nature.
- When incorporating semantic analyses into our probabilistic models, there is an advantage to going all the way!
- The compositional semantics of the prompt matters.
- Probabilistic dynamic semantics allows us to seamlessly incorporate it into our models of inference data.

# Modeling the prompt in inference judgment tasks

# Some implementation details

## Delta rules

# Outlook

## Other empirical domains

### Conventional implicatures (e.g., parentheticals)

### Evidentials (e.g., Sarah Murray's work)

### Non-canonical questions (e.g., Kyle Rawlins's work)

#### 'what if', resistance and resolution in discourse, epistemic resistance moves

### Socio-semantic inferences (e.g., Andrea Beltrama's work)

## Other kinds of experimental tasks

### Dynamics of imprecision (project with Yifan and Helena)

## Other uses of the framework

### Relating operational semantics of lambda-terms to response behavior (e.g., psychosemantics of 'most')
