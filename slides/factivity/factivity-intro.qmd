# Factivity and projection

## The phenomenon

While gradience in adjectives arises from reasonably well-understood sources, factivity presents a deeper puzzle.

::: {.incremental}
- **Traditional view**: Predicates either trigger presuppositions or they don't
- **Empirical reality**: Pervasive gradience in projection judgments
- **The challenge**: What explains this gradience?
:::

---

## What makes factivity special

Factivity = property of predicates associated with presupposition that complements are true

::: {.fragment}
Compare:

**Factive**: 
- Jo loved that Mo left. ⟹ Mo left.
- Jo didn't love that Mo left. ⟹ Mo left.
- Did Jo love that Mo left? ⟹ Mo left.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Non-factive**:
- Jo thinks that Mo left. ⏸ Mo left.
- Jo doesn't think that Mo left. ⏸ Mo left.

## An important distinction

There are two importantly distinct questions that we need to disentangle:

::: {.incremental}
1. Whether the gradience suggests that there is no *class* (or subclasses) of factive predicates
2. Whether the veridicality inferences triggered by a particular expression containing a particular clause-embedding predicate are themselves gradient
:::

::: {.fragment}
We'll focus on the latter question—PDS is uniquely positioned to ask it
:::

---

## The first question has been answered

@degen_are_2022 argue no clear line separates factive from non-factive predicates

::: {.fragment}
@kane_intensional_2022 show this gradience is likely due to task effects and measurement noise
:::

::: {.fragment}

![](plots/derived_factivity_measure.png){width=600}

When accounting for noise, standard subclasses of factives emerge
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Note**: Some subclasses (e.g., cognitive factives like *discover*) appear to be associated with non-necessary factive inferences—@karttunen_observations_1971 observed this 60+ years ago!
:::

## Two competing hypotheses

### Discrete-factivity hypothesis

- Factivity is discrete—speakers either interpret as factive or not
- Gradience reflects uncertainty about interpretation
- Analogous to lexical ambiguity

::: {.fragment}
### Wholly-gradient hypothesis

- No discrete factivity property exists
- Predicates make gradient contributions to complement truth
- Aligned with Gradient Projection Principle
:::

---

## Experimental paradigms

### The challenge

Judgments about certainty depend on:

1. Properties of the predicate (factivity)
2. World knowledge about proposition likelihood

::: {.fragment}
@degen_prior_2021 developed a two-stage design to tease these apart
:::

---

## Stage 1: Norming study

Measure world knowledge independent of embedding predicates:

::: {style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;"}
**Fact**: Sophia is a hipster.  
**Question**: How likely is it that Sophia got a tattoo?  
**Response**: [slider from 0 to 1]
:::

::: {.fragment}
Created high/low likelihood contexts for each proposition
:::

---

## Stage 2: Projection study

Embed propositions under predicates, ask about speaker certainty:

::: {style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;"}
**Context**: Isabella said that Sophia is a hipster.  
**Utterance**: Noah knows that Sophia got a tattoo.  
**Question**: Is Noah certain that Sophia got a tattoo?  
**Response**: [slider from 0 to 1]
:::

---

## Predicates tested

20 predicates spanning theoretical categories:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
- **Canonical factives**: *know*, *discover*, *realize*, *be aware*
- **Non-factives**: *think*, *believe*, *say*, *suggest*  
- **"Semifactives"**: *see*, *hear*, *notice*, *find out*
- **Variable behavior**: *confirm*, *admit*, *be right*
:::

---

## The empirical challenge

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](plots/projection_no_fact_means.png){width=600}

Continuous gradient of projection behavior
:::

---

## World knowledge: gradient or discrete?

First, test whether world knowledge itself is discrete or gradient:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
![](plots/norming_elpd.png){width=600}

Gradient model substantially outperforms discrete (ΔELPD = 442.3)

## Next: Models and Implementation

Now that we understand the phenomenon and experimental approach, let's see how PDS allows us to implement the competing theories as statistical models.
