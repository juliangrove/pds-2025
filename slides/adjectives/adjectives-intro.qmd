## Studying inferences: big picture

::: {.fragment}
Semantic inferences (e.g., entailments, presuppositions) are typically assumed to be [discrete]{.gb-orange}.

- They are turned on or off by linguistic expressions.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Semantic grammars model these inferences by:

- mapping words and phrases onto logical formulae compositionally; 
- determining if an inference "on" or "off" for the expressions of a significant chunk of the language.

## Vague adjectives

- *tall*, *wide*, *expensive*, *happy*, ... 
  
(@ex-coffee) The coffee in Rome is [expensive]{.gb-orange}. [@kennedy_vagueness_2007]
  
- True if: the cost of coffee in Rome is as great as a salient threshold, [$d$]{.gb-orange}:
  $$c ‚â• d$$
- Maybe the cost of coffee is 3 euros.
- $d$ is [vague]{.gb-orange}... maybe it ranges somewhere from 2 euros to 4 euros.

## Vagueness: strange inference patterns

Vague adjectives such as *expensive*

- admit [borderline cases]{.gb-orange}: 
  - Mud Blend: $1.50/lb \ \ üôÅ
  - Organic Kona: $20/lb \ \ ü•∞
  - Swell Start Blend: $9.25/lb ??

## Vagueness: strange inference patterns

- produce [sorites paradoxes]{.gb-orange}:

## Sorites: $10
  
Is a $10 cup of coffee expensive?

## Sorites: $9.99
  
Take $0.01 away. Is a $9.99 cup of coffee expensive?

## Sorites: $9.98
  
Take $0.01 away. Is a $9.98 cup of coffee expensive?

## Vagueness: strange inference patterns

- produce [sorites paradoxes]{.gb-orange}: 
  - Premise 1: A $10 cup of coffee is expensive. 
  - Premise 2: If an expensive cup of coffee were 1 cent cheaper, it would still be expensive.
  - Conclusion: *Therefore*, a [free]{.gb-orange} cup of coffee is expensive!
  

---

## Why tricky?
Borderline cases and sorites paradoxes: 
inference patterns that do not fall into any traditional semantic classification. 

- Borderline cases:
  things to which the adjective neither applies nor doesn't apply. 
- The inference is not simply "on" or "off".
- The sorites paradox: troublesome because... 
  - inferences should be closed under implication: 
	if $10 ‚Üù $9.99, and $9.99 ‚Üù $9.98, then $10.00 ‚Üù $9.98. 
	- *a $10 cup is expensive* ‚Üù *a free cup is expensive*

<!-- ## Imprecision -->

<!-- Kind of like vagueness: -->

<!-- (@ex-theater)  The theater is [empty]{.gb-orange} tonight. [@kennedy_vagueness_2007] -->

<!-- - True if the theater has five people when it usually has 300. -->
<!--   - *empty* is known as a [maximum standard absolute adjective]{.gb-orange}. -->
<!--     - The standard corresponds to complete emptiness.  -->
<!--   - Vague adjectives like *expensive*: [relative]{.gb-orange} adjectives.  -->
<!--     - The standard is determined relative to some context of use. -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## What makes imprecision a [thing]{.gb-orange}? -->

<!-- How is it different from vagueness? -->
	
<!-- - Borderline cases can be eliminated. -->
<!--   - [Context:]{.gb-orange} -->
<!-- 	the theater needs to be completely empty for the cleaning crew to work‚Ä¶ here, a single person can make a difference.  -->
<!-- - Lack of sorites paradoxes. -->
<!--   - Premise 1: A theater with zero people in it is empty. -->
<!--   - Premise 2: If an empty theater had one more person in it, it would still be empty.  -->
<!--   - [Nope!]{.gb-orange} -->

<!-- --- -->

## Inference judgments

Ongoing work with Helena Aparicio (Cornell Linguistics):

- Collect [scale norming]{.gb-orange} data. 
  - "X drank a coffee. Guess how [expensive]{.gb-orange} it was?" 
- Collect [adjectival inference]{.gb-orange} data. 
  - "X drank a coffee. How likely is it that it was [expensive]{.gb-orange}?" (vague) 

---

## Modeling pipeline

Using the norming data to help model the adjectival inference data: 

- Assume that people make likelihood judgments based on their probabilistic estimate of where an object lands on the adjective's scale.<br> 
- Then, we can model the distribution over these estimates *using* a model fit to the norming data.

## Norming task

<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/expensive_norming.png" style="width: 60%;">
</div>

- 6 relative adjectives
- 3 possible contexts for each adjective ("high", "medium", "low")

## Adjectival inference task

<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/expensive_test.png" style="width: 70%;">
</div>

- Same 6 adjectives (six relative, six absolute)
- Same 3 possible contexts for each adjective ("high", "medium", "low")
